Wade had held that states could not ban abortion before âviabilityâ - the point at which a fetus is viable outside the womb, generally viewed by doctors as between 24 and 28 weeks. Abortion access in a post-Roe America When abortion bans go into effect and why pills are the next fight With the Roe precedent now overturned, a patchwork of abortion access is emerging as each state decides how much time to give women to access abortion services. The 13 states with trigger bans already have or will soon reduce the time to obtain an abortion down from as much as 28 weeks to zero â a total ban. According to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights, seven additional states have in place abortion laws based on gestational age that had been considered unconstitutional under Roe and are currently blocked by courts. State courts could revisit these cases and shorten the time available to get an abortion. Florida and Arizona enacted 15-week bans earlier this year which are set to take effect in July and late summer, respectively. The states that have banned or are likely to attempt to ban abortion access generally have higher proportions of women who lack health insurance or are impoverished - or both. Insurance marketplace TrueCoverage estimates childbirth costs for an uninsured woman in the United States to be $10,000-$20,000, depending on the state. The costs of raising a child are also significant. Families should expect to spend close to $300,000 for food, shelter and other necessities to raise a child through the age of 17, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Medication-induced abortions have become more common over the past decade, with use of this method before nine weeks of pregnancy increasing 123% between 2010 and 2019. In such an abortion, a woman takes a series of pills to end a pregnancy rather than undergoing a surgical procedure. The states that have banned or plan to ban abortion may face difficulties enforcing restrictions on medication abortions because women are still likely to be able to obtain the pills online or in other states. \"In a world without Roe, medication abortion becomes the big challenge for these states that want to regulate abortions out of existence,\" said Greer Donley, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who is an expert on reproductive rights.

President Donald Trump said today that he is \"preparing for the military to secure\" the U.S. border with Mexico. \"We have very bad laws for our border,\" Trump declared. \"Until we can have a wall and proper security, we're going to be guarding our border with the military.\" Trump offered no additional details, so it's not clear exactly what sort of military personnel he has in mind for the border security job. Depending on how he plans to proceed, his hands may already be tied by federal law. Under the terms of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, no part of the Army or Air Force may be used for domestic law enforcement purposes \"except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.\" The act also applies to the Marines and the Navy via Department of Defense regulations, though not to the Coast Guard, which routinely performs domestic maritime police work. The restrictions set by the Posse Comitatus Act do not apply to National Guard troops, however, when those troops are operating under state authority. In recent years, such troops have performed border security work. In 2008, for example, President George W. Bush launched \"Operation Jump Start,\" in which 6,000 National Guard troops were deployed to California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas to offer various forms of border control assistance. President Barack Obama did much the same, deploying 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 2010. In short, if President Trump attempts to place active-duty Army troops at the U.S. border without congressional approval, he will be acting in violation of federal law. If he sends National Guard troops to the border, and those troops work with state authorities, he will be following in the footsteps of recent presidents.", "output": "center"}

Officials at 18 departments and agencies have submitted documents to a federal court detailing their efforts to rehire the laid off probationary workers to comply with the court orders. Last week, two federal judges said the mass layoffs of the recently hired workers was illegal and ordered them to be reinstated pending further litigation. The firings were part of Trump's efforts to slash the federal workforce, assisted by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). The filings made in a Baltimore federal court on Monday paint a clearer picture of the scale of layoffs across the federal government. They reveal that 7,600 people had been laid off from the Treasury Department, 5,700 from the Department of Agriculture, more than 3,200 from the Department of Health and Human Services, and hundreds from other departments and agencies. Many of the reinstated workers will not be heading straight back to work; they will instead be placed on administrative leave. On 13 March, Judge James Bredar of Maryland and Judge William Alsup of California ordered the agencies to rehire thousands of fired probationary workers. Judge Bredar's ruling did not stop the agencies from firing the workers, but took issue with the manner in which it was done. His decision came after a lawsuit was brought by 19 Democratic-led states and Washington DC, which argued that mass layoffs would trigger a rise in unemployment claims and add pressure on social services. In a later response to the government's efforts to reinstate the workers, the judge said the agencies had made \"meaningful progress toward compliance\". Separately, Judge Alsup criticised the decision to place the rehired workers on administrative leave, telling government lawyers that it \"would not restore the services the preliminary injunction intends to restore\". In response, the justice department said in its filings that placing workers on administrative leave was the first step towards fully reinstating them. The department has appealed both federal court decisions. These are not the only rulings against the US government's effort to reduce the size of the bureaucracy. On Tuesday, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from taking any further steps to shut down the US Agency for International Development (USAID).", "output": "center"}

A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Palestinian was not a flight risk or threat to his community and could be released as his immigration proceedings continue. Mr Khalil was a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests last year, and his 8 March arrest sparked demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. The government still wants to deport him, arguing his activism is detrimental to US foreign policy interests. Speaking to journalists before heading to New York from Louisiana, where he was held, he said he was most eager to see his wife and his son, who was born during his 104 days in detention. \"The only time I spent [with] my son was a specified one-hour limit that the government had imposed on us,\" he said. \"So that means that now I can actually hug him and Noor, my wife, without looking at the clock.\" He also criticised the Trump administration for targeting him for protesting against Israel's military actions in Gaza: \"There's no right person that should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.\" He did not specifically mention Israel, which emphatically denies accusations of genocide in Gaza, or Jewish people. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson accused Mr Khalil of engaging in \"fraud and misrepresentation\" and \"conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests\". The White House maintains that Judge Michael Farbiarz did not have jurisdiction to order Mr Khalil's release. \"We expect to be vindicated on appeal, and look forward to removing Khalil from the United States,\" Ms Jackson said. Khalil was held by ICE under two charges Mr Khalil, a permanent resident, graduated from Columbia while he was in detention. His wife took his place during the ceremony and accepted his diploma on his behalf. The government has not accused Mr Khalil of a specific crime. Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a rarely used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act to argue Mr Khalil's presence in the US could pose \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences\". Last week, Judge Farbiarz ruled Rubio's justification for detaining Mr Khalil was probably unconstitutional and said the US government could not detain or deport the 30-year-old legal US resident under that reasoning. Attorneys for the Trump administration then said Mr Khalil was being held for a different charge, failing to disclose information when he applied for lawful permanent residency in 2024. Mr Khalil's attorneys had argued that the government violated their client's free speech rights and the administration targeted him because of his role in protests. They also asked a New Jersey federal court to free him on bail or transfer him closer to his wife and baby. Throughout Friday's nearly two-hour hearing, Judge Farbiarz, who presides in the District of New Jersey, expressed scepticism about the government's requests to hold Mr Khalil while his case moved forward. He also said Mr Khalil's arrest and detention on the second charge were \"highly unusual\". - Who is Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian student activist facing US deportation? - US resumes student visas but orders enhanced social media vetting \"It's overwhelmingly unlikely that a lawful permanent resident would be held on the remaining charge here,\" Judge Farbiarz said, according to CBS News. He added that there had been an \"effort to use the immigration charge here to punish the petitioner\" for his protests. Under the conditions of his release, Mr Khalil will not have to wear electronic monitoring, and will be given certified copies of his passport and green card so he can return home. The government will retain his physical passport. The court barred Mr Khalil from international travel, but he will be permitted some domestic travel to New York and Michigan, as well as New Jersey and Louisiana for court appearances and attorney visits. He will also be permitted to travel to Washington for lobbying and legislative purposes. \"No one should fear being jailed for speaking out in this country,\" said Alina Das, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at New York University School of Law, who appeared in court to argue for his release on Friday. \"We are overjoyed that Mr Khalil will finally be reunited with his family while we continue to fight his case in court.\" \"After more than three months, we can finally breathe a sigh of relief and know that Mahmoud is on his way home to me and Deen, who never should have been separated from his father,\" said Mr Khalil's wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union.", "output": "center"}

Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the \"murder terrorist\". The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger. One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack. A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested shortly afterwards in Poway, north of the Californian city. The attack comes exactly six months after a shooting in Pittsburgh in which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. What did the rabbi say? Rabbi Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at the synagogue when he heard a noise - what he thought initially was a table falling over or a congregation member collapsing. \"As soon as he saw me, he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up,\" Rabbi Goldstein said on NBC's Sunday Today programme. \"I cannot erase that face from my mind.\" He held up his hands to shield himself but his fingers \"got blown away\". Rabbi Goldstein hurried through to the banquet hall where a number of children - including his granddaughter - were gathered. \"I just ran, not even knowing that my fingers were blown off and curled all the kids together and got them outside,\" he said. Lori Kaye, who helped found the synagogue with Rabbi Goldstein, was shot dead in the attack. \"Everyone in the community knew her,\" he said. \"I'm just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing.\" A 34-year-old man and a young girl suffered shrapnel wounds in the attack. Worshippers attacked, again By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor The routine is all too familiar. Another murderous attack on a place of worship, this time in San Diego, followed by the obligatory offer of prayers. \"Thoughts and prayers to all those affected\", tweeted President Donald Trump. Then, during a brief on-camera statement, Mr Trump said it looked like a hate-crime. \"Hard to believe,\" he added. Sadly, it is not hard to believe at all. Anti-Semitic incidents in the US surged 57% in 2017 - the most recent data available - the largest year-on-year increase since the century-old Jewish advocacy group began collecting data in 1979, says the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US. The horrendous attack in San Diego follows the deadliest attack on Jews in US history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October. It will now be added to the ADL figures. And the numbers, to tragic results, continue to rise. How did the attack unfold? Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an \"AR-15 type\" assault rifle. He said an off-duty border patrol officer had fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but had not not hit him. The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit. \"He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,\" Mr Nisleit said. \"As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle.\" San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic \"open letter\" published online. In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he had been inspired by the attack on two Christchurch mosques last month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting last October. The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers - charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - whom the author John Earnest calls an \"inspiration\". Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month. How has the Jewish community reacted? \"All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,\" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. \"My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in.\" Meanwhile, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined, \"Synagogue shootings - now a thing\". In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the US Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over. \"I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,\" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled \"Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews\". Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was \"outrageous\" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language. The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as \"global special interests\" and \"those who control the levers of power\" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were \"very fine people on both sides\" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted \"Jews will not replace us\".", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Trump India visit: Seven claims about India fact-checked President Trump kicked off a visit to India with an address to tens of thousands of people in a cricket stadium in Ahmedabad, in the state of Gujarat. The speech praised India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and highlighted the success of recent policies to improve the country. We looked at some of the claims. Claim 1: Trump said: \"Since the turn of the century, the size of the Indian economy has grown over six times in size.\" Reality check: Measured in terms of GDP - the sum of the value of goods and services produced in the economy - President Trump is correct. In 2000, India's GDP was $477 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By 2019, that figure had risen to an estimated $2,940bn. That's an increase of 6.2 times over the period 2000-2019. Reality Check has previously looked at Prime Minister Modi's pledge to expand India's manufacturing sector. India became the world's fifth largest economy in 2019, according to data from the IMF's World Economic Outlook. Claim 2: \"In a single decade, India has lifted over 270 million people out of poverty.\" Reality check: According to a 2018 UN report, there were 271 million fewer people living below the UN-defined poverty index in 2016, than ten years earlier. However, this same report notes that despite the gains in reducing poverty \"364 million Indians continue to experience acute deprivations in health, nutrition, schooling and sanitation.\" It also notes that about a quarter of all those defined as living in poverty are under the age of 10. Claim 3: \"Under Prime Minister Modi, for the first time, every village in India has access to electricity.\" Reality check: In 2018 the Indian government announced that it had reached its target of providing every Indian village with electricity. However, it's important to know what this actually means. The government defines a village as fully electrified if 10% of its households, as well as public places such as schools and health centres, are connected to the grid. By the time Mr Modi took office in 2014, 96% of the 600,000 villages in India had already been electrified. We checked this claim in full during last year's elections in India. Claim 4: \"The pace of highway constructions has more than doubled.\" Reality check: It's true that the total length of highways increased significantly after Mr Modi's BJP party came to power. The government built about 10,000km of highway in 2018-19. This is more than double the amount built in the last year of the previous Congress administration in 2013-14. The government set a similar target for this year. As of November 2019, 5,958km have been built. Reality Check has looked in-depth at the BJP's record on building roads. Claim 5: \"320 million more Indians are right now connected to the internet.\" Reality check: It's not entirely clear what internet connection refers to here. There are now more than 600m internet subscribers in India - a measure of internet use published by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. This figure has grown enormously in recent years, surpassing the 320m figure mentioned by President Trump. However, you're much more likely to have access to the internet if you live in a city rather than in the countryside - where most Indians live. There's also a gender disparity. Women are 50% less likely to use mobile internet than men, according to a 2019 study. Last year, Reality Check found that an ambitious project to establish the internet across rural India made strong progress early on, but was struggling to meet targets. Claim 6: \"600 million more people have access to basic sanitation.\" Reality check: In October 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat or Clean India Mission. The government built toilets for households with no access to basic sanitation facilities under this scheme. Latest figures from the Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation show that more than 100 million toilets have been built. We can't assess the figure of 600m, but every toilet would probably be used by multiple people. In April 2018, the prime minister also declared India open-defecation free. Reality Check has shown that rates of open defecation have fallen, although UN data indicates that the practice is still widespread. Claim 7: \"70 million more households, think of this, have access to cooking fuel.\" Reality check: Cooking gas was provided to poor households under a scheme launched by Prime Minister Modi in 2016. Under this scheme, 50 million liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections were to be provided to families below a certain level of income, with additional financial subsidies provided to refill cylinders for three years. According to the website of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, the Indian government fulfilled its target, and more than 80 million connections have been established as of September last year. In our own assessment last year, Reality Check found that the success of the project has been hampered by the high cost of having cylinders refilled.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "On Wednesday, David Grusch, a former military intelligence officer, told a House Oversight subcommittee that all those stories you’ve read on the internet are true: The government has debris collected from crashed alien spacecraft. He also told the assembled lawmakers that federal retrieval teams have collected biological remains from alien bodies. He also claimed the Pentagon has been working for years to collect and study crashed UAPs, or unidentified anomalous phenomena. Grusch, who considers himself a whistleblower, claims he has interviewed dozens of people, several of whom claim to have been injured by UFOs, now officially known as unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs. He also claimed the Pentagon has been working for years to collect and study crashed UAPs. That is a truly extraordinary claim, begging for extraordinary evidence. But where is the evidence? It’s MIA. Neither Grusch nor anyone else claiming to have knowledge of secret government UAP programs has ever been able to publicly produce convincing photos showing alien hardware splayed across the landscape. And remember, we’re not talking about a Cessna that plowed into a wheat field. We’re talking about, presumably, an alien interstellar rocket, capable of bridging trillions of miles of space, and sporting technology that is obviously alien. The believers maintain that such photos exist but are being kept under wraps. For reasons that are always unclear, the critical evidence that would convince anyone of alien presence in our 'hood is classified. It can’t be made public. Note that this week’s star witness, Grusch, made this claim, too. This is an argument I have long viewed with skepticism. Society should not (and generally does not) accept scientific “discoveries” without any evidence. The cure for cancer cannot be classified. If there really was some physical evidence of visitation, thousands of scientists would be fighting one another to study it. And the government would want it studied. This has always been another big sticking point in the UAP conspiracy theory universe. What is the point of hiding extraterrestrial technology in a Nevada hangar? What would be the goal, at this point, of shutting out the scientific community. The information, technology and — importantly — wealth incentives here seem overwhelming. Returning to the issue of visual evidence, there are thousands of satellites orbiting Earth. The majority sport cameras aimed downward. Actual alien craft in our airspace bigger than an office desk would likely be visible to satellites that — among other things — supply imagery to Google Earth. Hypothetically, a vast conspiracy to scrub such images could exist. And the American populace readily accepts conspiracy explanations. Ever since the government’s disingenuous response to the 1947 discovery of crash debris near Roswell, New Mexico, the public has decided that the feds will never tell civilians the truth about visiting aliens. Not even dead ones, such as the crew of the spacecraft that reputedly pancaked into the desert that year. This theory is even prevalent in the halls of Congress, as evidenced by this week’s testimony. But I still strongly maintain that alien visitation is not something that could be kept secret. The size of such a secret is just too big. Even the most conservative scientist can’t rigorously argue that it’s impossible for extraterrestrials to visit Earth. Nevertheless, a 2021 Gallup poll showed that more than 40 percent of Americans believe that some UFOs are alien spacecraft. And even the most conservative scientist can’t rigorously argue that it’s impossible for extraterrestrials to visit Earth. It doesn’t violate physics to go from one planet to another, even if that planet is in orbit around another star. Hard, yes. Impossible, no. But admitting that aliens could be here is a far cry from claiming that they are here. And that they somehow manage to arrange things so that they’re exclusively met by government employees anxious to hide them. And why is it that the aliens at least seem to invariably set their navigation hardware to visit America and not some other country that might not feel the need to keep these visitors under wraps? There is a kind of national hubris operating here: If extraterrestrial beings are going to come to Earth, they’re going to visit us! So have the aliens arrived? From the standpoint of science, there’s still no good evidence for that, only an “argument from authority.” David Grusch says they’re here. But either he can’t prove it, or he won’t. Until he does, we should consider his stories to be just that: stories.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "A popular no-calorie artificial sweetener that’s used in keto and other diets and some low-calorie foods may increase the likelihood of stroke, heart attack and even death, according to a new study by Cleveland Clinic researchers published in the journal Nature Medicine. Erythritol increased the likelihood of blood clot formation in the research, which involved nearly 4,000 patients in the United States and Europe who were being evaluated for heart health. Those with higher levels of the sweetener in their blood had more clotting. But the study authors also emphasized that each of those involved in the study was already undergoing voluntary cardiovascular disease risk evaluation at the time they were recruited for the study, suggesting a need for more research to see how well findings can be generalized to the population. The study also shows a link only, not causation. As The Washington Post reported, “Still, the results offer a significant challenge to product marketing that pitches erythritol as a healthy, natural sugar alternative. And the insights arrive as erythritol has come into vogue, with plant-based, keto and low-carb diet trends spurring interest in alternative sweeteners sold as ‘natural.’” Initially, the researchers weren’t studying particular products at all. They were analyzing blood samples of those at risk of heart disease collected over about eight years to see what chemicals and compounds might be linked to cardiovascular events. Per The Hill, “After discovering the link between the high levels and increased risk, the researchers confirmed their results by testing a larger sample from 2,100 people in the United States and 833 samples in Europe through 2018.” The article added that “‘Sugar-free’ products with erythritol are often recommended to individuals with obesity, diabetes or metabolic syndrome — who are already at risk for such cardiovascular health problems” according to the study. In a news release from Cleveland Clinic, the study’s senior author, Dr. Stanley Hazen, who chairs the Department of Cardiovascular & Metabolic Services and co-leads Prevention Cardiology, said, “Sweeteners like erythritol have rapidly increased in popularity in recent years but there needs to be more in-depth research into their long-term effects. Cardiovascular disease builds over time, and heart disease is the leading cause of death globally. We need to make sure the foods we eat aren’t hidden contributors.” The Cleveland Clinic release said that erythritol is “about 70% as sweet as sugar and is produced through fermenting corn. After ingestion, erythritol is poorly metabolized by the body. Instead, it goes into the bloodstream and leaves the body mainly through urine. The human body creates low amounts of erythritol naturally, so any additional consumption can accumulate.” It added that erythritol is “generally recognized as safe” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so long-term studies have not been required. “Our study shows that when participants consumed an artificially sweetened beverage with an amount of erythritol found in many processed foods, markedly elevated levels in the blood are observed for days — levels well above those observed to enhance clotting risks,” Hazen said. “It is important that further safety studies are conducted to examine the long-term effects of artificial sweeteners in general, and erythritol specifically, on risks for heart attack and stroke, particularly in people at higher risk for cardiovascular disease.” According to the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease, which includes heart attacks and strokes, accounted for 874,613 deaths in the United States in 2019. Other sweeteners ABC News quoted dietitian Anna Taylor, who suggested using fresh or frozen fruit as a sweetener. She “also suggests looking for other sugar substitutes like Stevia-based sweeteners that are herbal as opposed to artificial. “However, the study warns that erythritol is often combined with other sugar substitutes to help add bulk to the sweeteners,” per ABC News. Using natural sugars doesn’t remove all the risk, either. “Natural sugars like raw honey, maple syrup, agave nectar and raw sugar provide more nutrients than table sugar, including antioxidants, vitamins and prebiotic gut bacteria, but there are often hidden ingredients like high-fructose corn syrup, which has been linked to long-term metabolic complications, according to Taylor,” ABC reported.", "output": "center"}

Key Facts Brinton, who serves as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy’s Office of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition, was charged last month with felony theft and placed on leave after police claim Brinton stole a woman’s Vera Bradley suitcase at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport in September—Brinton initially denied taking the suitcase but later admitted they mistook it for their own. A felony arrest warrant was issued for Brinton on grand larceny charges on Friday after they were accused of stealing luggage at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. That suitcase included $1,700 worth of jewelry, $850 worth of clothing and $500 in makeup, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Fox News reported. In a tweet on Friday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called Brinton “a person clearly unfit for a high-level national security role,” accusing the Biden Administration of hiring Brinton because it “prioritizes wokeness over competence.” Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) called on Brinton to be fired and their security clearance revoked “IMMEDIATELY.” The far-right social media account Libs of TikTok—which has been accused of spreading anti-LGBTQ conspiracy theories including the debunked “furries” theory that children identify as animals in school—attacked Brinton for wearing women’s clothing and engaging in “pup play” in addition to stealing luggage. A group of House Republicans including Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) and Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) sent a letter on Tuesday to the Energy Department urging Brinton to resign, telling the department to “set aside petty politics and appoint only the most qualified and dedicated individuals to influence America’s energy sector.” The Department of Energy told Forbes it takes the accusation “very seriously,” but would not go into details on Brinton’s case—although generally speaking, department officials charged with a crime are put under review, which could result in a suspension or revocation of their clearance. Key Background Brinton, who identifies with they/them pronouns, is the first openly gender fluid employee in the federal government. According to multiple polls over the past five years, Americans have been divided along partisan and age lines over their acceptance of people who identify as transgender or gender fluid, with Republicans tending to favor more traditional gender-based definitions. A 2017 Pew Research poll found 32% of U.S. adults believe society has “gone too far in accepting transgender people,” including 57% of Republicans and 12% of Democrats. A follow-up Pew Research poll in June found 60% of Americans believe gender is determined by the sex people are assigned at birth, including 86% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats. Nearly two-thirds of respondents 65 years and older agreed, compared to half of people ages 18-29. GOP lawmakers have also proposed a series of laws targeting LGBTQ education and trans access in school bathrooms and on sports teams. One of the most high-profile was Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill, which prohibits instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity through the third grade. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the bill into law in May. In June, Greene, an outspoken proponent of traditional social values who has come down hard on LGBTQ rights, called for an end of Pride Month—which celebrates LGBTQ people. A series of GOP-funded attack ads leading up to the midterm elections last month targeted Democrats for expanding healthcare access to trans people. What To Watch For Brinton, 34, is set to appear in court on Dec. 19, where they face felony charges from the Minneapolis theft allegation punishable by up to five years and prison and a fine of up to $10,000.

Democrat Jerry Nadler, chairman of the House judiciary committee, argued it is entitled to an unredacted version. Mr Trump's legal team argues it completely exonerates the president. The Department of Justice has reacted by calling the subpoena \"premature and unnecessary\". It said it would \"continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognised executive branch interests\". Elizabeth Warren became the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for Mr Trump to be impeached. \"The severity of this misconduct demands that elected officials in both parties set aside political considerations and do their constitutional duty,\" said the Massachusetts senator. The 448-page redacted document is the result of a 22-month investigation by Robert Mueller, who was appointed to investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. It includes large swathes of redactions, which Mr Nadler says \"appear to be significant\" in revealing how Special Counsel Mueller and his team came to their conclusions Democrats have promised to continue pursuing Donald Trump following the release of the report on Thursday. What's in the report? Mr Mueller's report says he found no criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's campaign and Russia, but could not reach a concrete legal conclusion on whether Mr Trump tried to obstruct the investigation. \"If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,\" the report says. \"Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. \"Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\" The report also reveals: - Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try to get Mr Mueller removed over alleged \"conflicts of interest\", but the lawyer resigned because \"he did not plan\" to follow the directive - Mr Mueller examined 10 actions by the president in regards to obstruction of justice, which he said largely \"took place in public view\" - The report says that potential obstruction of justice by the president only failed because members of his administration refused to \"carry out orders\" However, about 10% of the report is redacted - which means it may include yet more revelations. What do Democrats say? Mr Nadler issued the subpoena for the full, unredacted version on Friday, giving the US attorney general until 1 May to respond. \"My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,\" Mr Nadler said. \"The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case.\" Democrats had already vowed to call Mr Mueller to publicly testify before congress about the work he has done, with Congresswoman Jackie Speier telling the BBC that Mr Mueller had \"basically tossed the ball to Congress and said, 'you need to pursue obstruction of justice here'.\" Allow X content? Democrats have also attacked US Attorney-General William Barr, accusing him of \"misleading\" them with an earlier summary of the report's findings regarding whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Barr held a news conference before the report was made public in which he backed the president. How has Mr Trump responded? Mr Trump celebrated on Thursday, saying it was a \"good day\" and that there was \"no collusion\" and \"no obstruction\". But first thing on Friday he took to Twitter to attack \"the Crazy Mueller Report\" which he said was written by \"Angry Democrat Trump Haters\" and was \"fabricated\" and \"totally untrue\". Representatives for the president had earlier reiterated his view that the investigation was a \"hoax\" and called for reprisal inquiries. \"President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again,\" Mr Trump's 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \"Now the tables have turned, and it's time to investigate the liars who instigated this sham investigation into President Trump, motivated by political retribution and based on no evidence whatsoever.\" How have the Russians reacted? Russia has dismissed the findings of the report, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying it contained \"no new information\". \"As a whole the report as before does not present any reasonable proof at all that Russia allegedly meddled in the electoral process in the US,\" Mr Peskov told reporters on Friday.", "output": "center"}

Over the past two years, Mewar has spent nearly all of her life savings seeing heart and respiratory specialists, haematologists, urologists, dermatologists and more, in a desperate bid to tame her long-COVID symptoms. She has taken a slew of drugs: beta blockers to calm her racing heart, steroid inhalers to ease her laboured breathing and an antimalarial drug prescribed to her for reasons she never fully understood. And when Mewar — a curator at an art museum in Ahmedabad, India, who has been sick since what was probably a bout of COVID-19 in March 2020 — would visit her lung doctor twice a month, he always told her the same thing: you need to exercise. “I can’t even walk to the bathroom,” she would reply. It’s an unwelcome odyssey undertaken by millions of people living with long COVID, a complex and sometimes debilitating syndrome that can linger for months or years after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is no proven treatment, leaving physicians and people with the condition to play whack-a-mole with its many symptoms. And sometimes, people with the syndrome turn to untested, self-prescribed therapies. Although at least 26 randomized clinical trials of long-COVID therapies are under way (see ‘Trials take off’), many are too small or lack the necessary control groups to give clear results. “If you look at long COVID at this moment in time, I’d paint a slightly ‘Wild West’ and desperate picture really,” says immunologist Danny Altmann at Imperial College London. Even so, researchers are narrowing in on the pathology that underlies long COVID. In the next year, key trials could yield results for drugs that target the immune system, blood clots or lurking fragments of the coronavirus itself. “I’m still optimistic,” Altmann says. “The right stuff is going on, and there’s a fair amount of funding out there. Something is going to give.” Complex condition A key barrier to developing long-COVID treatments has been uncertainty about the condition’s root cause. Over the past two years, a number of hypotheses have emerged as frontrunners, and researchers hope that insight into which ones are correct could help them to develop therapies. Evidence is mounting that lingering SARS-CoV-2 — or fragments of it — continues to cause trouble by stimulating the immune system. There are also signs that the infection generates antibodies that mistakenly attack the body’s own proteins, causing damage long after the initial illness. Researchers have found hints that COVID-19 could cause microscopic blood clots that block oxygen flow to tissues. It is also possible that a SARS-CoV-2 infection can wreak long-term havoc on gut microorganisms. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive: many researchers think that long COVID can have multiple causes. Each idea suggests a route to relief. Antiviral drugs might vanquish persistent reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. Drugs that suppress the immune system could quench a misguided immune response. Powerful anti-coagulants could dissolve micro-clots. Although evidence is gradually accumulating in support of each of these possibilities, their links to long COVID are still tenuous enough to give some investigators pause before launching clinical trials. “The hypotheses are getting a bit stronger,” says Altmann. “But they’re not cast iron.” This uncertainty could dissuade researchers from launching trials, says epidemiologist Martin Landray, at the University of Oxford, UK. If long COVID has a number of causes, a promising treatment could be ruled ineffective in a clinical trial simply because it was given to the wrong group. Plus, there is no shortlist of key symptoms to help to enrol participants or sort them into subgroups. More than 200 symptoms have been associated with the syndrome1, and many — such as fatigue and brain fog, two of the most common and debilitating — are hard to measure objectively, and can wax and wane. “I’ve had a whole list of symptoms; half of them I’ve forgotten,” says Mewar, who keeps a library of photographs of the medicines she has tried, to keep track of her treatments amid the brain fog that permeates her memory. “They would come and go, here a week, and then gone.” All of this complicates clinical-trial design, says Landray, an architect of RECOVERY, a large UK trial of treatments for acute COVID-19. That trial took just four months to find that low doses of the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths from severe COVID-19 by one-third. Landray has received requests from people with long COVID and their families to engineer a similar effort to address long COVID. “I haven’t gotten involved in this space,” he says. “The science hasn’t seemed sufficiently mature.” A trickle of trials But some researchers have pushed ahead. Several trials try to tame errant immune responses. Some of these rely on familiar drugs, such as colchicine, an anti-inflammatory drug that treats gout and is often prescribed to people with long COVID. Other trials are using drugs that have shown some success in treating severe acute COVID-19, including steroids and other immunosuppressants, such as sirolimus, which is used to prevent organ rejection after a transplant. Small trials and anecdotal reports suggest that antihistamines show some promise, and they provide “a Band-Aid solution”, says Hannah Davis, who has long COVID and lives in New York City. Davis is a co-founder of the Patient-Led Research Collaborative, a research and advocacy group. “But it would be good to confirm that it’s helping.” Rheumatologist James Andrews at the University of Washington in Seattle is investigating a new approach to taming inflammation in people with long COVID: an experimental drug called RSLV-132. The drug, made by Resolve Therapeutics in St Petersburg, Florida, is designed to remove RNA circulating in the blood, where it is thought to promote inflammation, says Andrews. The company has tested its drug in small trials for other conditions and has found some success in reducing fatigue in people with Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder. Other approaches aim to manage symptoms, such as extreme fatigue, muscle weakness and memory and concentration difficulties. Roger McIntyre, who studies psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, Canada, is enrolling participants in a trial of vortioxetine, an antidepressant that has been shown to boost cognition, to find out whether it alleviates the brain fog associated with long COVID. Another set of trials aims to tackle COVID-19’s lingering impact on the cardiovascular system. Some studies have found evidence of inflammation in the lining of blood vessels and suggest that, in some people, this could trigger the formation of microclots that then clog the lung’s tiniest vessels, the capillaries2. Cardiologist Rae Duncan, at Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK, and her colleagues are planning to launch a clinical trial to test a cocktail of drugs targeting this clotting process. Duncan says when she presented her clinical-trial plans to a panel of people with long COVID and their advocates, two of them became emotional: “They said, ‘This is the trial we’ve been waiting for.’” Duncan does not yet want to disclose which drugs have been chosen, out of fear that people with long COVID will try to buy them on the Internet and treat themselves. “These are individuals who are very sick at the minute and who are understandably desperate for treatment,” she says. “These drugs do increase your risk of bleeding and need to be administered and monitored very carefully.” Already, some people with long COVID have been taking treatment into their own hands. Some have taken a combination of anticoagulant drugs to replicate a triple-drug therapy that was tested in a small trial of 24 people with long COVID. That trial did not include a control group and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal3. Others, says Davis, have been traveling to clinics that will perform apheresis, a procedure that filters the blood with the aim of removing clots or proteins that can promote inflammation. These people have paid thousands of dollars for the unproven procedure, often after spending months on a waiting list, she says. Future hopes Some of the most logical candidate drugs for long COVID are still not being tested in trials. Several antivirals are used against acute COVID-19. Some researchers think these drugs could ease the symptoms of long COVID, too — particularly as evidence grows that a lingering SARS-CoV-2 reservoir could trigger the condition. Two antivirals were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration at the end of last year — molnupiravir (Lagevrio), made by Merck in Rahway, New Jersey, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics in Miami, Florida; and a combination consisting of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid), made by Pfizer in New York City. Another drug, remdesivir (Veklury), made by Gilead Sciences in Foster City, California, has been used to treat COVID-19 since the early days of the pandemic. But there are still no registered studies directly looking at whether these antivirals — which are expensive and in relatively short supply compared with generic drugs — could ease long-COVID symptoms. An indirect assessment of Lagevrio and Paxlovid’s impacts on long COVID could come later this year: both companies say researchers will continue to follow clinical-trial participants for six months after treatment. Gilead is exploring collaborations to test remdesivir in people with long COVID. As data pile up on how common and long-lasting long COVID can be, pharmaceutical companies might be persuaded to launch more studies, says David Strain, who specializes in medicine for older adults, at the University of Exeter, UK. On 1 June, the UK Office for National Statistics announced that 1.4 million people in the United Kingdom reported lingering symptoms three months after acute infection. About 380,000 people had been experiencing symptoms for at least two years. Soon after those numbers were released, a pharmaceutical company agreed to sponsor a trial of an antiviral drug that Strain had proposed be tested; he will not say which, because the deal has not yet been finalized. “It’s taken a while to get to a position where the companies are ready to start investing,” he says. “The drugs are expensive.” Each of these trials could help researchers to better understand the causes of long COVID, as well as how to treat it — as long as trials include detailed analyses of markers associated with the condition, such as autoantibodies, says immunologist Akiko Iwasaki, at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. “This is an opportunity to learn more about the disease, as opposed to just finding a cure,” she says.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "As the U.S. presidential election looms, some Gen Zers might be walking around as a liar, liar, (with their) pants on fire. So finds Axios in its poll of more than 1,800 registered voters, conducted by the Harris Poll between October 22 and 24. Almost a quarter (23%) of respondents across generations say they have lied to someone close to them about who they’re voting for, but that number is highest among Gen Z—at 48%. The number of fibbers decreases as respondents age, at 38% of millennials, 17% of Gen Xers, and 6% of boomers. A veil of secrecy shrouds what has been deemed one of the closest elections in modern history. More than half (58%) of respondents say their vote is a private matter. “There’s a new privacy emerging here, where it’s far more convenient to either lie or not talk about it,” John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Axios, pointing to prevalent polarization, a fear of post-election unrest, and younger generation’s desire to not engage in in-person conflict. Lying tends to crop up when there’s someone to lie to. In other words, mixed company and increased polarization might increase the likelihood that someone feels like they need to bluff. A third of respondents say they’re not close to family members because of their different political beliefs. That increases to 47% of millennials and 44% of Gen Zers. Despite some young adults staying secretive, many vocally oppose those who disagree with them. True to Gen Zers’ reputation, a TikTok trend has cropped up where voters joke that they’re “canceling out” their family members’ votes. Gen Z’s gender divide Men are almost twice as likely to lie about their vote than women, at 30% and 17%, respectively. It’s unclear who they’re lying to and why. But at the same time, a widely reported gender gap in younger generations is at play. While the verdict is still out, data from Gallup covered by the Financial Times found that men in the U.S., Germany, and South Korea are becoming increasingly conservative. Women, on the other hand, are becoming more liberal—by a gap of 30 percentage points in the U.S. Pointing to the impact of #MeToo as women spoke out against long-standing abuse and sexism, the Times’ John Burn-Murdoch notes there’s a “clear progressive-vs-conservative divide on sexual harassment.” Young women are also more liberal than men when it comes to their stance on immigration and racial justice, Burn-Murdoch adds. While much has been said about polarization in a two-party system, Republicans have actually moved further right than Democrats have to the left, according to a separate Gallup survey of Congress members. In this cycle, abortion rights are a key part of the ballot after the overturn of Roe v. Wade—which was passed in the 1970s. That’s all to say, women are likely moving left as their politicians and male peers move to the right at an unprecedented pace. Even with the gender divide, there is at least one thing Gen Zers can agree on: From both sides, young people want their government to address critical issues, like climate change, economic inequality, and democracy’s future. They feel a sense of fatalism at their politicians’ failure to do so, according to two studies from UC Berkeley researchers. While vocal, Gen Z is most quiet at work The most junior working generation is also the least likely to talk to coworkers about politics and most likely to feel uncomfortable doing so out of all generations, according to Gallup. It’s perhaps surprising given Gen Z’s reputation of being a more radical and vocal generation, but not unexplainable. “It could be that younger workers are newer to the workforce and less comfortable speaking freely,” Katelyn Hedrick, a co-author of the Gallup analysis, told Fortune. “They are getting acclimated, forming relationships with people in the organization, and wanting to build a strong career brand which may make them more hesitant to speak about politics at work.” Boomers are at the top of the corporate ladder, which might be why they’re the least likely to lie to someone about their beliefs. By nature of their seniority and just age, they might be more honest. They’re running the room, after all.", "output": "center"}

An explosion at St George's Coptic church in Tanta killed 27 people. Hours later, a blast outside St Mark's Coptic church in Alexandria left 17 dead. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the explosions, the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Christian minority in the country. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi ordered military deployments across Egypt. In a statement, he said the army would be sent to protect \"vital and important infrastructure\". The government announced three days of mourning. In Alexandria, Pope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Church, had been attending Mass inside the church targeted but was not hurt, state media reported. Several police officers, including one policewoman, were among those killed, the interior ministry said. The suicide bomber blew himself up after they stopped him from entering the church. The first explosion in Tanta, 95km (60 miles) north of Cairo, took place near the altar of the church. It remains unclear if it was also caused by a suicide bomber. \"I saw pieces of body parts and broken seats. There was so much blood everywhere, some people had half of their bodies missing. The first three rows [inside the church] were destroyed,\" Nabil Nader, an eyewitness, said. The explosions injured at least 71 people in Tanta and 35 others in Alexandria, the health ministry said. The blasts appear to have been timed for maximum impact, as people gathered to mark Palm Sunday. It is one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking the triumphal entry of Jesus Christ into Jerusalem. Egyptian security forces had been put on alert in anticipation of attacks. The attacks come weeks before an expected visit by Pope Francis intended to show support for the country's Christian minority. He condemned the explosions. \"I pray for the dead and the injured, and I am close in spirit to the family members [of the victims] and to the entire community,\" the Pope said., external The Copts and Egypt: By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab affairs editor The Copts are one of the most ancient Christian communities and the largest still left in the Middle East. But they have long felt vulnerable and marginalised. This sense of precariousness has only increased in recent years, with the rise of violent jihadism in parts of Egypt. The country's political and Muslim religious leaders have tried to provide reassurance that they stand united with the Copts - and have portrayed the recent upsurge in attacks as an attempt by extremists to sow division. But in recent months, Coptic families have been fleeing the northern Sinai after a series of murders and assaults. Their trust in the state's ability and willingness to protect them will now be even more deeply shaken - as bombs desecrate Palm Sunday, fulfilling a rash of recent threats by the Islamic State group to intensify their violence against Christians in Egypt. Pope Tawadros II told local TV that \"sinful acts will not undermine the unity and coherence of the Egyptian people in the face of terrorism\". In the UK, the General Bishop of the Coptic Orthodox Church, Bishop Angaelos, condemned, external the \"senseless and heartless brutality\" of the attacks. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said on Twitter, external that he had \"great confidence\" that President Sisi would handle the situation \"properly\". Violence against the religious minority has risen in recent years, especially since 2013, when the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood, and launched a crackdown against Islamists. Some Morsi supporters blamed Christians for supporting the overthrow. In February, IS warned of more attacks against Copts, who make up about 10% of Egypt's population. What is the Coptic Christian faith? The Coptic Orthodox Church is the main Christian Church in Egypt. While most Copts live in Egypt, the Church has about a million members outside the country. Copts believe that their Church dates back to around 50 AD, when the Apostle Mark is said to have visited Egypt. Mark is regarded as the first Pope of Alexandria - the head of their church. This makes it one of the earliest Christian groups outside the Holy Land. The Church separated from other Christian denominations at the Council of Chalcedon (451 AD) in a dispute over the human and divine nature of Jesus Christ. The early Church suffered persecution under the Roman Empire, and there were intermittent persecutions after Egypt became a Muslim country. Many believe that continues to this day. Copts in Egypt: Recent developments December 2016: 25 people died when a bomb exploded at the Coptic cathedral in Cairo during a service.

Key Facts Walmart confirmed to several outlets, including Bloomberg and the Associated Press, that it is making broad changes—including no longer giving priority treatment to suppliers based on race and gender, ending racial equity training for staffers and exiting from the LGBTQ rights group Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. The supposed changes were first announced on X by prominent anti-DEI conservative pundit, Robby Starbuck, who said the move was in response to the threat of him doing a “story on wokeness” at the company ahead of the key holiday shopping season. Starbuck claimed he had “productive conversations” with executives at Walmart who promised to implement these changes. The company confirmed to Bloomberg that it had held conversations with Starbuck, but claimed it was already reviewing its DEI efforts before that. Aside from changes to its DEI policies, Walmart has also agreed to monitor its online marketplace for listings by third-party sellers that Starbuck describes as “sexual and/or transgender products marketed to children” and remove them if necessary. The company also told AP it plans to review grants for Pride events to ensure it was not “financially supporting sexualized content that may be unsuitable for kids.” Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

Crucial Quote In his post, Starbuck noted: “I have to give their executives major credit because this will send shockwaves throughout corporate America. This is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America.” Tangent Billionaire Elon Musk—who himself is a vocal critic of DEI initiatives and has reshared and responded to Starbuck’s posts previously—praised the conservative pundit’s latest announcement. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who is also president-elect Trump’s pick to be the next U.S. ambassador to Israel, also hailed Starbuck calling him “perhaps the most influential person in America restoring our culture & country to sanity.” Key Background Starbuck, who has more than 700,000 followers on X, has emerged as one of the most prominent conservative figures targeting companies over DEI initiatives. Starbuck scored his first win earlier this year, after his online campaign against Tractor Supply’s DEI policies forced the retailer to reverse course. At the time, the company announced it would stop sponsoring Pride events, stop submitting data to the Human Rights Campaign and withdraw its carbon emission goals. Starbuck would go on to target several other major companies, including Ford, Lowe’s and Harley Davison, who have all since also rolled back their DEI measures. Big Number 1.6 million. That’s the total number of workers Walmart hires in the U.S. according to its website. This makes it the biggest American company so far to have rolled back its DEI initiatives. What To Watch For The right-wing pundit indicated in an X post that he was not done targeting companies, especially large retailers. Starbuck wrote: “Companies like Amazon and Target should be very nervous that their top competitor dropped woke policies first.

By taking part in a vaccine trial, you'd be a major player in moving science forward so the world can finally get a grip on the virus that's been overloading hospitals, taking lives and forcing lockdowns for more than six months now. With more than 10 million cases worldwide and more than half a million deaths, it's clear that we need an intervention. If you want to be one of the first to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, now's your chance: Find out who can join, how to join and where to join. What is a vaccine study? A vaccine study is a type of clinical trial that looks at the effectiveness of potential vaccinations for infectious diseases. These studies are necessary to determine whether a vaccine can prevent people from becoming sick with diseases, without causing serious side effects. Every single vaccination goes through a rigorous process that involves multiple stages. In some cases, such as in the case of the novel coronavirus, national health agencies -- usually the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration -- will agree to expedite the process due to an emergency. COVID-19 is no doubt an emergency, and the vaccine development process is being accelerated through Operation Warp Speed, which aims to make 300 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine available by January 2021. Current coronavirus vaccine studies More than 130,000 people have signed up to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine study less than two weeks after the National Institutes of Health launched its COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN), a network supporting several clinical studies that will test \"a variety of investigational vaccines.\" Four major studies are planned for summer and fall 2020, the first of which is expected to test the Moderna vaccination, the first vaccine to enter human trials earlier this year. The other trial vaccines come from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax. All CoVPN studies are Phase 3 trials, which means it's already clear that the vaccinations don't cause immediate adverse effects, and the final goal is to find out if the vaccination can prevent people from contracting the coronavirus or minimize the severity. Who should join a coronavirus vaccine study? The CoVPN is looking for adults (18 and older) of all races, ethnicities, sexes and gender identities to join studies. You don't have to be in perfect health, either: Researchers want participants who are older and have underlying health conditions to participate, because those people are more likely to become sick with COVID-19 -- and the point of these trials is to find out if the vaccines can prevent people from becoming sick. Researchers are also interested in recruiting people of color, because it's clear that those communities have been hit harder by the novel coronavirus. For a vaccine to be successful, it has to be successful for all races. Pregnant women are also eligible to participate in coronavirus vaccine studies. An important thing to remember is that these trials can be time-intensive for participants. For any CoVPN studies, you'll be required to visit a research site 10 to 12 times throughout your trial. You'll also have to keep track of how you feel in the hours and days after receiving your shot, and respond to follow-ups from research coordinators. If you can't make the time commitment, you may not want to sign up for a coronavirus vaccine trial. Fighting coronavirus: COVID-19 tests, vaccine research, masks, ventilators and more See all photosThe risks of a vaccine study You should also, of course, be aware of the potential risks of signing up for a vaccine trial. In the best case scenario, at least one of the investigational coronavirus vaccines is successful and none of them cause illness or adverse side effects. However, even Phase 3 vaccine trials come with the risks of developing illness and side effects. If you choose to participate in a study and are selected, you'll be given an informed consent form, which details all of the risks you incur by participating. Participation is totally voluntary, and if anything on the informed consent doesn't feel comfortable for you, you can opt out. You're also allowed to opt out at any time during a clinical trial, but it helps researchers when participants remain for the entire duration of trials. How to join a coronavirus vaccine study You can join any of the government-sponsored coronavirus vaccine trials by going to the CoVPN website. There, you can begin the screening process to find out if you're eligible to participate in the clinical studies. The first step is a 10-minute survey that asks for your contact information, birthday, weight, height, and other demographic information. The survey also asks some personal and lifestyle questions, many of which aim to determine how likely you are to be exposed to the virus. You could be rejected based on your answers to these questions. For example, if you work from home, never have visitors, wear a mask when you leave, and live alone, you might not be a good fit for a vaccine trial, because you don't have many opportunities to be exposed to the virus. Thus, the researchers wouldn't be able to tell if the vaccine protected you or if your lifestyle protected you. If researchers deem you a good fit for a vaccine trial, they'll reach out to you about participating in a study. Because there are several planned vaccine trials with many research sites across the US, you might be contacted within days, or it might take months. Testing sites for coronavirus vaccination trials According to the NIH, there will be more than 100 testing sites in the US, and your information will be sent to your nearest testing site, based on the zip code you provide during the initial questionnaire. If you're selected to participate in a vaccine trial, a research coordinator will contact you and provide more information about the testing site and trial process.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the federal government could have acted faster on reining in immigration programs, after blaming “bad actors” for gaming the system. Mr. Trudeau released a nearly seven-minute video on YouTube Sunday talking about the recent reduction in permanent residents being admitted to Canada and changes to the temporary foreign worker program. Over the next two years, the permanent residency stream is being reduced by about 20 per cent to 365,000 in 2027. In the video, Mr. Trudeau talked about the need to increase immigration after pandemic lockdowns ended in order to boost the labour market, saying the move helped avoid a full-blown recession. But after that, Mr. Trudeau said, some “bad actors” took advantage of these programs. “Some saw that as a profit, to game the system. We saw way too many large corporations do this,” Mr. Trudeau said. The Prime Minister added that “too many” colleges and universities used international student programs to “raise their bottom line” as non-Canadian students pay significantly higher tuition. He also said scammers targeted “vulnerable immigrants” with bogus paths to citizenship. “Looking back, when the postpandemic boom cooled and businesses no longer needed the additional labour help, as a federal team we could have acted quicker and turned off the taps faster,” Mr. Trudeau said. From there, Mr. Trudeau talked about the new immigration plan with the stated goal of lowering the number of permanent and temporary immigrants coming to Canada. In addition to a phased reduction in new permanent residents over the next two years, recent changes have made it more difficult for employers to get temporary worker permits approved. Mr. Trudeau said the goal of the government’s immigration reduction is to help stabilize population growth while housing stocks catch up, and then to consider gradually increasing immigration rates once again. When reached for comment, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s spokesperson Sebastian Skamski referred The Canadian Press to an interview Mr. Poilievre did with CKNW 980’s The Jas Johal Show in Vancouver where Mr. Poilievre discussed immigration. In that interview, Mr. Poilievre said much of his criticism of the current immigration system is coming from what Mr. Trudeau himself has said since enacting these recent changes. “Now, he’s basically denouncing his entire immigration policy and expecting us to believe that he can fix the problems that he caused,” Mr. Poilievre said. “The bottom line is we have to fix our immigration, get back to the best system in the world, the one that brought my wife here as a refugee legally and lawfully, the one that brought so many people here to pursue the Canadian promise and that’s what I’m going to do as prime minister.” Mr. Poilievre has previously said he would tie immigration rates to available housing while considering other factors such as access to health care and jobs. Speaking on background, an official from the Prime Minister’s Office said that the video is being released as another means of communicating government policy to Canadians. As for concerns around the potential for increased irregular migration with U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s deportation promises, the official said the video was recorded before the American election.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social network's decision not to send speech from politicians to third-party fact-checkers, a move that's drawn scrutiny, especially from Democrats in the US. \"I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true,\" Zuckerberg said during a nearly 40-minute speech at Georgetown University. The remarks highlight the social network's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech and combating misinformation during elections. They could also escalate tensions between Facebook and politicians as the 2020 campaign season heats up. Democrats and civil rights groups swiftly criticized Zuckerberg's speech, arguing that the company hasn't learned from its past mistakes. Zuckerberg said providing people a voice and including everyone are central to everything he creates, comments that come as he fends off criticism that his company wields too much power over social and political discourse. He championed the role of technology platforms, saying they had \"decentralized\" power. \"People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I actually believe that the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people's hands.\" He also pushed back against the idea of banning political ads, arguing that this would favor incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover. But it's an idea the company has considered, Zuckerberg said. Facebook has faced mounting pressure to do more to combat misinformation, hate speech and other offensive content on the world's largest social network, which has 2.5 billion users. The company also faces allegations that it censors conservative speech. Facebook has repeatedly denied that charge. Over the last month, the company's hands-off approach to political speech has sparked more outrage. In particular, Democrats have lambasted a policy that allows politicians to post false information in ads on the social network. Earlier this month, Facebook rejected a request from Joe Biden's presidential campaign to pull down an ad from President Donald Trump's re-election campaign that contained misinformation about the former vice president. In response, presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, a US Democratic senator from Massachusetts, ran an ad containing the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump. She did it to prove a point about the social network's policy, and the ad noted that it included misinformation. Zuckerberg said Facebook's policy isn't designed to benefit politicians but \"because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying.\" In a Q&A after the speech, Zuckerberg said he doesn't think that allowing politicians to lie in ads is \"pro-conservative.\" Bill Russo, a spokesman for Biden's presidential campaign, said in a statement that Facebook is allowing politicians to target Americans with \"disproven lies and conspiracy theories.\" \"Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,\" Russo said. Civil rights group Color of Change said Zuckerberg is \"doubling down on a business model\" that harms democracy. \"Under the guise of protecting voice and free expression, Facebook, as in prior elections, is giving Trump and the right-wing a free pass to spread lies, hate and misinformation on the platform,\" Color of Change President Rashad Robinson said in a statement. Zuckerberg has been talking to conservatives about their concerns regarding bias. He's had a quiet series of dinners with aggrieved conservatives to hear their complaints. In September, he also visited Trump and lawmakers from both parties during a rare visit to Washington, DC. On Friday, Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear on Fox News for the first time. The threat from deepfakes But with the 2020 US presidential election just around the corner, lawmakers are more worried about the spread of misinformation on social media. One big concern: \"deepfake\" videos that use AI to make it appear like a person is uttering words they aren't. \"I think figuring out which types of deepfakes are actually a threat today, versus are a theoretical future threat once the technology advances, is one of the things that we need to make sure we get right,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Washington Post. Earlier this year, Facebook faced criticism for keeping up a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made the Democrat seem like she was slurring her words. Facebook doesn't ban misinformation but will show it lower in users' news feeds if fact-checkers rate the information as false. Zuckerberg's speech touched on a wide range of topics, including calls to break up Facebook and the company's previous efforts to enter China. Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook's position that breaking off Instagram and WhatsApp from the company wouldn't solve woes around privacy and other issues. He said the social network couldn't strike an agreement with China, but the silver lining is that the company has more freedom to fight for free expression. During the speech, Zuckerberg referenced the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Vietnam War and movements such as #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. That didn't sit well with some civil rights activists. King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, said in a tweet that she wants Facebook to better understand the challenges her father faced from political disinformation campaigns. \"These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination,\" she tweeted. Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, said Zuckerberg's reference to the movement she helped start showed a lack of \"integrity.\" \"If he wants to use our movement to claim support for Black communities, then Black lives have to matter more than his bottom line,\" she tweeted. Meanwhile, Facebook has been trying to improve how it moderates the billions of posts that flow across its site every day. The company is forming an oversight board to weigh in on some of its toughest content decisions. The board, expected to be made up of 40 members, plans to start hearing appeal cases next year. \"Building this institution is important to me personally because I'm not always going to be here,\" Zuckerberg said, \"and I want to ensure the values of voice and free expression are enshrined deeply into how this company is governed.\" Originally published Oct. 17, 10:28 a.m. PT.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Biden bans offshore drilling across vast area of US US President Joe Biden has announced a ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of America's coastline, weeks before Donald Trump takes office. The ban covers the entire Atlantic coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific coast off California, Oregon and Washington and a section of the Bering Sea off Alaska. It is the latest in a string of last-minute climate policy actions by the Biden administration ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump has vowed to revoke the ban \"immediately\" when he takes office, but he may find it difficult to reverse under US law. During his campaign, Trump pledged to \"unleash\" domestic fossil fuel production in a bid to lower gas costs, despite the US already seeing record high extraction rates. Announcing the new drilling ban, Biden said: \"My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses, and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation's energy needs. \"It is not worth the risks.\" In a radio interview, Trump branded the ban \"ridiculous\". \"I'll unban it immediately,\" he said. \"I have the right to unban it immediately.\" Trump has previously said he will reverse Biden's conservation and climate change policies. For the new drilling ban, Biden is taking the action under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953, which allows US presidents to withdraw areas from mineral leasing and drilling. The law does not grant presidents the legal authority to overturn prior bans, according to a 2019 court ruling. It means a reversal would likely require an act of Congress, which is now controlled by Trump's Republicans. The law also does not allow presidents to revoke any areas already leased for offshore drilling. Trump - despite being in favour of more oil and gas exploration and repeatedly deploying his tag line \"Drill, baby, drill\" during campaigning - has used the law himself to protect waters off the coast of Florida in 2020. At the time, this was seen as an effort to garner votes from the state ahead of the 2020 US election, and the protection was due to expire in 2032. Biden's decision will protect the same area with no expiry date. The new offshore drilling ban covers more than 625 million acres (253 million hectares) of waters. After it was reported last week that Biden would introduce the policy, Trump's incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it \"a disgraceful decision\". She said the move was \"designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices\". Environmental groups, however, welcomed the move. Joseph Gordon, from conservation organisation Oceana, said: \"This is an epic ocean victory. \"Our treasured coastal communities are now safeguarded for future generations.\" An oil and gas industry trade group said Biden's decision would harm American energy security and should be reversed by Congress. Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said: \"We urge policymakers to use every tool at their disposal to reverse this politically motivated decision and restore a pro-American energy approach to federal leasing.\" In 2017, during his first term in office, Trump tried to reverse former President Barack Obama's protection of 125 million acres (50.6 million hectares) of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. Two years later, a US District Court ruled that the act did not allow a president to reverse decisions of previous administrations – meaning Trump could not revoke Obama's protections. It is expected that Trump - whose inauguration ceremony takes place on 20 January - will still seek to challenge Biden's move. A final legal decision could be made by the Supreme Court, which currently has a majority of Republican judges. Environmentalists and Democrats had been calling on Biden to introduce the ban because of concerns that any new drilling would threaten US ambitions to cut its greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change. The International Energy Agency estimates that global oil and gas demand needs to fall by 5% annually to limit global temperature rise to 1.5C, which is seen as crucial to help avoid the most damaging impacts.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Coronavirus threatens the world’s economic life, and current proposals from governments around the globe are failing to match the scale of the crisis. Today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced £330bn of loans and that some companies would not have to pay business rates for the next 12 months. While loans help businesses in the short term, they do not compensate for losses and only allow companies to smooth costs over a longer period. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested direct cash payments to individuals. Such measures (such as $1,000 given to each US household) help to alleviate temporary economic hardship but are poorly targeted: it’s too little for those who lose their jobs, and it is not needed by those who don’t. During social distancing, the goal should not be to increase demand, since people can no longer spend on many goods and services. Unemployment insurance, or benefits, and paid sick leave policies come closest to helping laid off workers and those unable to work, but they do not prevent redundancies and do not help businesses. Tax relief, such as the business rate holiday offered by the UK to sectors most affected by the recession, such as hospitality and retail, will help. But there’s no guarantee this relief will be enough to prevent bankruptcies and job losses. There is, however, a radical and targeted solution to the specific causes of the coronavirus global recession: governments should step in as payers of last resort, which means they would cover wage and maintenance costs for businesses facing shutdown. In the context of this pandemic, we need a new form of social insurance, one that directly helps both workers and businesses. So, how does this work in practice? The drop in demand caused by social distancing measures, and a following decrease in output and therefore GDP, is expected to be short, probably for a few months. Governments cannot undo this direct output loss, but they can prevent a very sharp but short recession becoming a long-lasting depression. Absent government actions, and many businesses and workers do not have enough liquidity to weather dramatic shortfalls in demand causing mass redundancies. Keeping businesses alive through this crisis and making sure workers continue to receive their wages is essential. The most direct way to provide this insurance is to have governments act as payers of last resort, so that hibernating businesses can keep paying their workers (known in economic terms as idle workers) instead of laying them off, and can keep paying their necessary bills such as rent, utilities and interest instead of going bankrupt. In practice, in the US, the unemployment insurance system is already up and running, making it possible to compute and deliver compensation to idle workers. Workers should immediately start receiving special unemployment insurance benefits so they are no longer a cost to their employers – even though they stay formally employed – and no re-hiring process is needed once they can come back to work. Self-employed individuals (such as gig workers) could report themselves as idle and be eligible for this special unemployment insurance. In case of partial idling – if someone’s working hours have been cut – unemployment insurance benefits would be prorated. These benefits would be progressive if they replaced a higher fraction of earnings for low-paid workers. This is a desirable feature, as low-paid workers are more likely to be affected by the lockdown (ie less likely to be able to work from home) and less likely to have savings to replace a temporary loss in earnings. In the payer-of-last-resort programme we envision, businesses on lockdown would report their monthly necessary costs of maintenance and receive payment from the government. Necessary costs are rent, utility payments, interest on debt, health insurance (in the US) and national insurance contributions (in the UK) of idle workers, and other costs that are vital for the maintenance of businesses. For partially shut down sectors, governments would pay a fraction of the maintenance costs. The amounts don’t need to be exact; verification and correction can take place once the lockdown is over. Any excess government payment could be transformed into an interest-free loan that could be recouped over several years. There are two reasons why such a policy would work in the case of the coronavirus pandemic. First, it is clear what is driving the shock: a health crisis that has nothing to do with any business’s decision and will be temporary. Second, different industries are affected differently. That’s in contrast to normal recessions, where the drop in demand is widely spread and has no clear timeline. How much would such a payer-of-last-resort programme cost? Based on national account statistics by industry, we estimate that with a nationwide lockdown up to 30% of aggregate demand could evaporate in the US over the next three months, leading to a 7.5% drop in annual GDP. Compensating idle workers and necessary business maintenance costs would involve government payments of around half of this total. Unemployment insurance replaces about 50-60% of wages, and essential maintenance costs of businesses are probably less than half of their normal operating costs (for example, non-flying planes do not burn fuel). The total cost for the government would be around 3.75% points of GDP, financed via an increase in public debt. The direct output loss from social distancing measures would in effect be put on the government’s tab, ie socialised. A payer-of-last-resort programme will work if it is limited in time (eg three months), so the cost remains manageable and business decisions are not affected. It would not fully offset the economic cost of coronavirus. No matter what governments do, there will be real output losses. Even if airline workers are paid, the plane rides won’t happen. For other sectors, supply-chain distortions will happen no matter what, due, for example, to quarantine measures. But a payer-of-last-resort programme would alleviate the hardship on workers and businesses. It would maintain the cash flow for families and businesses so the coronavirus shock has no secondary impacts on demand – such as laid-off workers cutting down on consumption – and a quick rebound can take place once demand comes back. Business activity is on hold today, but with an intravenous cash flow it can be kept alive until the health crisis is over.", "output": "left"}

With the two sides on the brink of all-out war, Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel, including a longer-range projectile that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel. It was the group’s farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges. Israel said it intercepted the projectile, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. Hezbollah said it had fired a ballistic missile at the headquarters of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, which it said was responsible for the targeted killing of its senior leaders. Israel said it struck the site the missile was launched from in southern Lebanon. Families that fled southern Lebanon flocked to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria. Issa Baydoun fled the village of Shihine when it was bombed and drove to Beirut with his extended family. They slept in vehicles on the side of the road because the shelters were full. “We struggled a lot on the road just to get here,” said Baydoun, who rejected Israel’s contention that it hit only military targets. “We evacuated our homes because Israel is targeting civilians and attacking them.” Volunteers cooked meals for displaced families at an empty Beirut gas station that first became a hub for relief after a devastating port explosion in 2020. Israel said late Tuesday that fighter jets carried out “extensive strikes” on Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa region to the north. Asked about the duration of Israel’s operations in Lebanon, military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said at a news conference that it aims to keep them “as short as possible, that’s why we’re attacking with great force. At the same time, we must be prepared for it to take longer.” Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France. Israel said a strike in Beirut Tuesday had killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who it said was a top Hezbollah commander with the group’s rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death. It was the latest in a string of assassinations and setbacks for Hezbollah, the strongest political and military actor in Lebanon and widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world. Lebanon’s Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country’s National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building. The U.N.’s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south. Hezbollah said its missile attacks Tuesday targeted eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron Yaakov, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border. It fired 300 rockets, injuring six soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. The renewed exchange came after Monday’s barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006. Dozens of mourners in the Lebanese village of Saksakieh carried 11 bodies through the streets Tuesday, including those of four women, an infant and a 7-year-old girl. (AP video/ Emad Hadad) On Tuesday, mourners carried 11 bodies through the streets of the Lebanese village of Saksakieh, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Lebanon-Israel border, including those of four women, an infant and a 7-year-old girl. All were killed in Israel’s bombardment of the village Monday. Some of the bodies were draped in Hezbollah flags, others wrapped in black clothes. A wreath of flowers was placed on top of the smallest one. Mohammad Halal, father of 7-year-old Joury Halal, said his daughter was an “innocent child martyr.” “She is a martyr for the sake of the south and Palestine,” Halal said and defiantly stated his allegiance to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles). NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track U.S. wildfires, but can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. Data from Monday showed significant fires across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded — a staggering toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week’s escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote. The Israeli military says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one. It has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October. Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. Monday’s escalation came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday, when Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel. Last week, thousands of communications devices used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. ___ Melzer contributed from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Merkel, who has been Chancellor since 2005, made the announcement during a news conference today in Berlin. “It is time today for me to start a new chapter,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin. “This fourth term is my last term as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. In the next Bundestag election in 2021, I will not run again as Chancellor. I will not run for the German Bundestag any more, and I do not want any other political office.” Merkel told reporters that being Chancellor has been a “very challenging and fulfilling task.” Merkel’s decision appears to mark the beginning of the end of her 13-year dominance of European politics. Angela Merkel's life in pictures Merkel also announced on Monday that she would stand down from the chairmanship of her center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party after 18 years in the post. She said that she’s known since the summer break that she no longer wanted to be the CDU chairman and that during the party’s conference in December she will not run again for the position. The announcement is a sign of Merkel’s weakened power within her own party, and waning popularity in the country. Both parties under Merkel’s ruling coalition – the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) – suffered heavy losses in a regional election over the weekend. While the CDU remained the largest party in the election, which was held in the central state of Hesse, its vote was down 10% from the previous election. Loss of voters trust This weekend’s election was a second blow to Merkel’s fragile “grand coalition” government. On October 14, the Christian Social Union, or CSU – the Bavarian sister party to the CDU – lost its majority in the Bavarian state parliament. The CSU has dominated politics in the state since the end of World War II, ruling for all but three years over the course of nearly seven decades. Speaking on October 15, Merkel admitted that voters had lost trust in the government. Bavaria bore the brunt of the 2015 refugee crisis; at its peak, thousands of asylum seekers were crossing into the state every day. Since then, both Merkel and her CSU allies have been criticized for their management of the influx. What this means for Germany and beyond Leopold Traugott, policy analyst at think tank Open Europe, told CNN that Merkel was a stable leader in a “global politics that’s become increasingly disorderly.” He said that while Germany needs to look for a new leading figure, allies and opponents abroad “will have to prepare for a different, perhaps more difficult partner in Berlin.” “Germany will become even more inward-looking in the near future – a trend we have seen since last year’s general election already,” Traugott said. “This means there will be less German involvement in key European debates, but also on global issues the country is less likely to take a leading role. “It will be particularly painful for French president Emmanuel Macron, who was hoping for Merkel’s support in his plans for wide-reaching European reform. It seems ever less likely he will receive this support from Berlin.”", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The American oil industry is facing a doomsday scenario. The coronavirus pandemic has caused oil demand to drop so rapidly that the world is running out of room to store barrels. At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia flooded the world with excess supply. That double black swan has caused oil prices to collapse to levels that make it impossible for US shale oil companies to make money. US crude for May delivery turned negative on Monday – something that has never happened since NYMEX oil futures began trading in 1983. It was easily the oil market’s worst day on record. US crude for June delivery is still trading above $20 a barrel — but even that’s disastrous. “$30 is already quite bad, but once you get to $20 or even $10, it’s a complete nightmare,” said Artem Abramov, head of shale research at Rystad Energy. Many oil companies took on too much debt during the good times. Some of them won’t be able to survive this historic downturn. In a $20 oil environment, 533 US oil exploration and production companies will file for bankruptcy by the end of 2021, according to Rystad Energy. At $10, there would be more than 1,100 bankruptcies, Rystad estimates. “At $10, almost every US E&P company that has debt will have to file Chapter 11 or consider strategic opportunities,” Abramov said. OPEC cuts failed to end the panic The most stunning part of the record low in oil prices is that it comes after Russia and Saudi Arabia agreed to end their epic price war after President Donald Trump intervened. OPEC+ agreed to cut oil production by a record amount. Trump said the OPEC+ agreement would save countless jobs and much-needed stability to the oil patch. “This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States,” Trump tweeted on April 12. “I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia.” Yet crude has kept crashing, in part because those production cuts don’t kick in until May. And demand continues to vanish because jets, cars and factories are sidelined by the coronavirus pandemic. The hope in the oil industry is that Monday’s negative prices are somewhat of a fluke caused by the rolling over futures contracts. The record low in the May contract comes on very thin trading volume ahead of Tuesday’s expiration. That’s because there are concerns that there will be no room to store those barrels delivered in May. The June contract, however, only dropped around 10% to $22 a barrel. And Brent crude, the world benchmark, fell just 5% to $26.50 a barrel. Still, oil contracts roll over each month and they don’t crash to record lows. “There will be a lot of companies that don’t survive this downturn,” said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. “This is one of the worst on record.” ‘Unprecedented’ stress in the oil industry Signs of stress abound in the oil patch. The S&P 500’s energy sector has lost more than 40% of its value this year — despite the dramatic rebound in the overall stock market over the past month. Noble Energy (NBL), Halliburton (HAL), Marathon Oil (MRO) and Occidental (OXY) have all lost more than two-thirds of their value. Even Dow member ExxonMobil (XOM) is down 38%. Whiting Petroleum became the first domino to fall when the former shale star filed for Chapter 11 protection on April 2. But it certainly won’t be the last. Rystad’s $20 scenario predicts more than $70 billion of oil company debt will get reorganized in bankruptcy, followed by $177 billion in 2021. And that only accounts for exploration and production companies, not the servicing industry that provides the tools and manpower to drillers. The key will be how long oil prices stay dirt cheap. A rapid rebound in prices could allow many oil companies to avoid bankruptcy. Buddy Clark, co-chair of the energy practice at Houston law firm Haynes and Boone, said his firm is “extremely busy” working on potential oil bankruptcies. Haynes and Boone has been forced to pull lawyers from other areas of the firm to work on the oil problem. “I don’t think I’ve seen anything like it in my lifetime. It’s unprecedented,” said Clark, who started working in the industry in 1982. Clark thinks that despite the further collapse in prices, there will still be only — “only” — 100 oil bankruptcies in 2020. “It’s hard to believe that 100 bankruptcies is the optimistic view. That just shows you where we are,” Clark said. Liquidations could be on the way There would probably be more bankruptcies already if it weren’t for the extreme volatility in oil prices. Clark said companies are having trouble drawing up restructuring plans because they don’t know what the price of the commodity will be. “Ironically, the lower price has slowed down the process,” Clark said. “A number of companies may have teed up filings but they need to go back to the drawing board.” The dire outlook in the oil industry will make it very difficult for companies attempting to reorganize in Chapter 11 proceedings to get the required financing and support. Debtholders who would normally swap their debt for equity may not want that equity. That means, unlike the 2014-2016 crash, some oil companies may not survive altogether. “Chapter 11 requires financial sponsors to back you. You may see more Chapter 7 liquidations,” said Reid Morrison, US energy leader at PwC. The nightmare scenario could present lucrative buying opportunities for the industry’s biggest players. That’s because struggling oil companies, either in bankruptcy or before it, will be forced to sell off prime acreage – at fire sale prices. Exxon and Chevron (CVX), the industry’s supermajors, could be tempted to make acquisitions. “Those with strong balance sheets will be able to take advantage of the situation,” said Morrison. However, he noted the supermajors will be “cautious about pulling the trigger” in the next six months because they must defend their coveted dividends first. The next dominoes? The oil crash has set off a guessing game about which companies will be next to succumb to bankruptcy. The most vulnerable companies are the ones that piled on too much debt, face looming debt maturities and can’t generate cash flow to even make their interest payments. Rystad’s Abramov said “no one would be surprised” if Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Oasis Petroleum (OAS) were forced to consider bankruptcy. Chesapeake recently suspended dividend payments on preferred stock. Its stock price crashed so low that it turned to a one-for-200 reverse stock split to comply with exchange requirements. Shale driller Oasis has lost more than 90% of its value this year. Its stock is trading below 30 cents. Although American frackers rebounded from the 2014-2016 oil crash, there are concerns the shale industry could be permanently scarred. Investors were already tired of the industry’s horrible returns following years of excessive spending and oversupply. And that was before the great oil crash of 2020.", "output": "left"}

Within hours of Politico’s reporting on a leaked draft Supreme Court opinion on Monday, people flooded the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., protesting against the court’s apparent plan to overturn the landmark abortion protections of Roe v. Wade. By late Tuesday, hundreds more had gathered outside the nation’s highest court. Queer activists — whose rights to same-sex marriage and consensual sex are also threatened by the draft opinion — led chants of: “Abortion rights are under attack — what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” Elsewhere on Tuesday, activists organized rallies outside federal courthouses across the country, from Oakland, California, to Richmond, Virginia, to Dallas, Denver and Sarasota, Florida. In New York City, hundreds gathered at Foley Square outside the federal courthouse downtown — one protester’s sign read: “Get your fucking hands off our bodies.” In Knoxville, Tennessee, people held hand-made signs reading “Abortion is healthcare” and “We can’t go back.” In Austin, Texas, hundreds gathered outside the state Capitol, with at least one person carrying a sign that read: ”My body, my choice.” “No more shame, no more silence, forced motherhood is fascist violence,” chanted young activists in Chicago. If Roe is overturned, low-income, Black and Latinx people would be disproportionately impacted by a lack of access to safe abortion. “Women will fight back like we always have,” the Women’s March said in a statement on the Tuesday rallies, which were organized by several pro-choice groups. “We’re showing up for abortion rights, saying bans off our bodies, and demanding that elected officials take action before the Court gets the chance to overturn abortion.” Republicans have long sought to restrict abortion across the country. Currently, 26 states are likely or almost certain to ban abortion in the case of a Supreme Court decision overturning Roe, according to the pro-choice Guttmacher Institute. It’s worth noting that the court’s draft decision is not final and that abortion remains legal in all 50 states for now. In response to the draft leak, progressive Democratic lawmakers have been calling for the Senate to abolish the filibuster to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would guarantee access to abortion care nationwide. Sunrise Movement told HuffPost that they were planning another protest with March for Our Lives and other youth-led groups on Thursday outside the Supreme Court to call for the Senate to codify Roe v. Wade into federal law. “We are entering an era where our parents had more reproductive rights than us,” the youth-led groups said. “Decades of progress are being erased by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. ... Our generation will not stop fighting for reproductive rights.”", "output": "left"}

Don’t Go to War With Yourself. “The difference between not doing anything at all and doing 10 minutes a few times a week is absolute.” New Year’s resolutions are a time for reflection—a chance to think about the limited time we have on this Earth and how to use it wisely. Oliver Burkeman is a writer who focuses on this nexus of mortality and productivity. He is the author of Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mere Mortals (4,000 weeks is about the length of the average American’s life span). I caught up with him to discuss New Year’s–resolution making and breaking, and why you should consider not setting your resolutions until mid-January. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity. Caroline Mimbs Nyce: Do you think New Year’s resolutions are worth making, considering we’re all going to die, as your book posits so bluntly? Oliver Burkeman: [Laughs.] I don’t think the fact that we’re all going to die means that setting intentions for personal changes is automatically a bad thing. Confronting how short our lives are, and how limited our time is, is actually a sort of precondition for doing meaningful things, including making personal changes. It helps you get a lot of clarity about which kinds of resolutions are really worth using your precious time on and which are not. I do think that in the culture of New Year’s resolutions, there’s a really heavy dose of perfectionism—a sense in which it’s all about starting completely afresh and being completely perfect in some area of life from this day forward. I don’t think fresh starts like that are actually possible, and I don’t think aiming to make them is the healthiest way to change. Nyce: A lot of the most popular resolutions are around money and eating and losing weight. Do you think those are worth considering, given our finite amount of time on the planet? Burkeman: I don’t think it’s a question of the subject matter. Anything could be the most important thing for a given person to focus on. Nyce: Are you totally topic agnostic? Like, if your goal is to eat more cupcakes in 2023, go for it? Burkeman: I suppose I’m not 100 percent topic agnostic. There are some activities where it’s pretty hard to suggest that they would be a part of anybody’s meaningful life. But I’m pretty topic agnostic. The crucial question we have to ask ourselves is why we’re doing things. It’s so obviously the case that more physical exercise can improve the quality of some people’s lives. But it’s also so obviously the case that there are people who are punishing themselves in some way or another through exercise. I do think that probably one of the pitfalls of New Year’s–resolution culture is that it encourages us all to buy into the idea that you need to make some big change in order to be a minimally acceptable, worthwhile person. And that doesn’t leave any room for the thought that maybe you’re more okay than you thought. Maybe you don’t need to change in some particular way. Maybe reconciling yourself to certain ways that you are is a more powerful thing. A psychotherapist called Bruce Tift has this really interesting thought experiment: Whatever it is that you dislike most about yourself—your short temper or your lack of self-discipline—just imagine if that thing was going to be with you in some form ’til the end of your life. What if you were never going to change the thing about you that you so desperately long to change? I think, for a lot of people, that’s quite a liberating thought. What possibilities might open up if you knew that you weren’t going to change that thing? Nyce: I feel like so much of your book is about freeing yourself from the productivity trap—understanding that there are infinite choices you can make in a life, and not feeling guilt that you don’t answer every email and cross every item off your checklist. And yet, New Year’s resolutions are almost all about that. Burkeman: I think, if you look into the deep motivations driving them, often, it’s like, 2023 is finally going to be the year that I transcend the human condition—the year I overcome the temptation to eat junk food, with more self-discipline than any human ever could have. It’s like, “Well, it’s not going to be the year that you transcend the human condition.” Because nobody ever can. Nyce: Talk to me a little bit about what resolutions might make sense if we were to stop treating our lives as though they are something to be tamed. Burkeman: It’s helpful for resolutions to be resilient—ones that you’re going to be able to stick with even when life doesn’t run as perfectly as you planned. I like the idea that Dan Harris, the meditation writer and podcaster, talks about, which is resolving to do things “day-ish”—the notion that you can make your plan for change a lot more sustainable if it’s not so rigid that one missed day spells failure. The other thing is just to remember that the difference between not doing anything at all and doing 10 minutes a few times a week is absolute. It’s the same idea as “the best kind of workout to do is the one you’re actually going to do.” If it happens to not be the ideal physical regimen according to science right now, that couldn’t matter less. I don’t think there’s anything helpful about resolutions that put you at war with yourself. Often, it’s basically just a resolution to, like, shout even louder at yourself this year until you finally do the things that you think you ought to be doing. That kind of internal combat never works in the end, because you start to resent the person who’s yelling at you to do all these things—even if that person is yourself. Nyce: Are there any anti-resolutions, let’s call them, that you would consider having people make? Burkeman: There’s something appealing about the idea of just postponing New Year’s resolutions until the first week or two of January. Otherwise, you get past the incredibly symbolic January 1 date, and it’s like, Well, any hope I had of changing in 2023 is gone; I’ve already failed. It’s also important not to let the idea of changing your personality get in the way of just actually doing things differently. Probably many people have done the kind of thing where they are like, I’m going to start being the kind of person who keeps in touch with old friends. Every week, I’m going to reach out to two friends who I haven’t talked to for ages. And it actually ends up being a disincentive to just getting in touch with one friend today. This notion of changing our habits can be an obstacle to just right now, today, once doing a thing. If you’re daunted by becoming a runner or becoming a meditator, just go for a run; just sit down and meditate. When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act. But American Jews who care about fighting antisemitism should be against it. HR 6090, the Antisemitism Awareness Act, passed 320–91. Seventy Democrats and 21 Republicans voted against it (including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who noted that she was against antisemitism but wanted to protect her Christian right to say that Jews killed Jesus). The legislation would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism. There are some who have long opposed codifying this particular definition because it comes with troublesome examples, most of which have to do with Israel. These include things like “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor,” “applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation,” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.” Under this definition, then, Masha Gessen’s New Yorker essay on Holocaust memory and Israeli policy in Gaza would be considered antisemitic under the law. Gessen is a Jewish descendant of Holocaust survivors and victims. There are many, including Zionist Jews, who have long warned that the IHRA standards could be used to chill pro-Palestinian speech. After the House passed the bill, Americans for Peace Now CEO Hadar Susskind warned in a statement: Antisemitism is the hatred of Jews. Unfortunately, one doesn’t need to look far to find it these days. But the supporters of this bill are looking in the wrong places. They aren’t interested in protecting Jews. They are interested in supporting right-wing views and narratives on Israel and shutting down legitimate questions and criticisms by crying “antisemite” at everyone, including Jews, who oppose the Netanyahu, Ben-Gvir, Smotrich government. Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York also opposed the bill: I will take lectures from no one about the need for vigorous efforts to fight antisemitism on campus or anywhere else. I am also a deeply committed Zionist. … But while this definition and its examples may have useful applications in certain contexts, by effectively codifying them into Title VI, this bill threatens to chill constitutionally protected speech. Speech that is critical of Israel—alone—does not constitute unlawful discrimination. By encompassing purely political speech about Israel into Title VI’s ambit, the bill sweeps too broadly. I agree with all of this. I think a bill that effectively restricts speech on the country’s foreign policy has no business being passed in the United States. This bill would be a problem if it only restricted Palestinian Americans from describing their families’ histories or present realities. That codifying this definition in a bill fighting antisemitism would also deem many Jews antisemitic—including the quarter of American Jews who in 2021 said Israel is an apartheid state—undercuts its stated reason for being. But I also think you do not have to disagree with the IHRA—you can, in fact, feel that this definition is a sound one—to believe that this law is a mistake. All you have to do is remember that, as a minority in the United States, American Jews have been as safe and secure as we are because of liberalism, pluralism, and civil rights. American Jews take pride in American Jewish participation in the Civil Rights Movement, and for good reason. But it isn’t just that some American Jews have stood up for civil rights, though that is true. Protection of civil rights has also helped American Jews. When American Jews stood up for freedom of expression and the right to be full political participants, they were also standing up for their own rights. In 1963, speaking before the March on Washington, Rabbi Joachim Prinz said, “America must not become a nation of onlookers. America must not remain silent. Not merely Black America, but all of America. It must speak up and act … not for the sake of the Black community but for the sake of the image, the idea, and the aspiration of America itself.” He might have added “for the sake of every minority community.” Freedom of religion and the right to express that religion in public by, say, freely speaking out against prayer in schools has long protected Jewish equality in American life. The same goes for the freedom to protest American domestic or foreign policy—against, for example, the Vietnam War (as many American Jews did). These fundamental rights are a large part of why American Jews are free to participate in public life as both Americans and Jews. So, this debate is about not just one piece of legislation or even freedom of speech. It extends to First Amendment rights more generally. A recent YouGov poll found that 59 percent of American Jews believe that colleges have not been harsh enough in their responses to pro-Palestinian, anti-war protests. Many may have thus been heartened to see police break up the protests. I can understand that some American Jews dislike the protests, filled as they are with calls of “From the river to the sea” and “intifada revolution,” which many American Jews hear as cries to violently get rid of Jews, even as most of those chanting insist that that’s not what they mean. Many Jews may think the protests are singling out Israel in a world full of atrocities, or that the protesters are failing to mention Oct. 7 and the hostages. But even those who cannot admit that the students have been moved to protest by months of war and tens of thousands of deaths in Gaza, including thousands of children, should remember that come January, it is entirely possible that the U.S. president will once again be Donald Trump. And when that happens, all of these rights may soon be tested not only on the issue of U.S. support for Israel in this war but in every facet of American life. Under a second Trump administration, many Jews will want to protest its actions—not only the plight of Gaza’s civilians and of the Israeli hostages—and this law will endanger the right to do that. Trump has, for example, said that he would let states monitor women’s pregnancies and prosecute those who have abortions. American Jews overwhelmingly support the right to an abortion, which was, for many American Jews, a top electoral issue two years ago. (Some have even argued in court that protecting abortion rights is required by Jewish law.) But agitating against state policy on abortion and for abortion rights has historically involved protests—and will surely continue to do so. Sometimes that protest involves being places you have been asked to leave. Given the timing, it is difficult not to see the Antisemitism Awareness Act as at least in part a justification for police crackdowns on protest. Establishing a precedent for more violent crackdowns mere months before the arrival of an administration that will push policies opposed by most American Jews seems, at best, shortsighted. But this isn’t about just the constitutional right to protest. It’s also about American Jewish autonomy. Indeed, there is another, self-serving reason for American Jews to oppose the government’s defining antisemitism or passing legislation that could be used to restrict speech around American policy: Stopping this bill from becoming law will protect the right of American Jews to define for themselves what it means to be American Jews in a pluralistic country. Trump has repeatedly said that he feels that Jews who did not vote for him are disloyal and need to be spoken to, and he dined with Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist and Holocaust denier. But even generously leaving that aside for a moment: Trump’s allies are, per Politico, planning “to infuse Christian nationalist ideas in his administration should the former president return to power.” They have listed Christian nationalism—the idea that, despite this country’s separation of church and state, Christianity should be prioritized through the government and in the public sphere—as a priority for his second term. This effort is reportedly being overseen by Russell Vought, Trump’s former Office of Management and Budget director, who is close to Trump administration official William Wolfe, “who has advocated for overturning same-sex marriage, ending abortion and reducing access to contraceptives.” (It is perhaps worth noting here that the current speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, believes that separation of church and state is a “misnomer” and has ties to explicitly Christian nationalist groups.) These are the people who could soon be back in power. There are already many American Jews who oppose the new proposed legislation because we believe in freedom of speech and because we know that imposing a definition on a particular type of hatred and combating that hatred are two different things. But for others, perhaps it is worth remembering that the people who will be in power come January may well care more about policing speech around the Jewish state than they do about the Jews who live here, in this country. Biden, in his speech at the Capitol for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Days of Remembrance on Tuesday, said, “On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class. Antisemitism, antisemitic posters, slogans, calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world’s only Jewish state.” He also said, “From the very founding, our very founding, Jewish Americans represented only about 2 percent of the U.S. population and helped lead the cause of freedom for everyone in our nation. From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy.” Threats to minorities and the foundation of democracy can come in many forms. The Antisemitism Awareness Act imposes a definition of antisemitism. Actual awareness of antisemitism, on the other hand, means holding on to the civil liberties that have helped us fight antisemitism in this country—not hampering them.", "output": "left"}

But the US government has taken a “heavy-handed approach” to the demonstrations, with authorities using force “more often than not” when they are present, the report found. And there has been a troubling trend of violence and armed intimidation by individual actors, including dozens of car-ramming attacks targeting demonstrators across the country. The new data on protests and the US government’s response comes from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled), an organization that has long tracked political violence and unrest in regions around the world, together with Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative. Data assembled by Acled has been viewed as a reliable source of information on the death toll in Yemen, civilians killed by governments in Africa and political violence against women, among other conflicts. The organization launched a new “US crisis monitor” project this year, concerned that the US is “at heightened risk of political violence and instability going into the 2020 general election”. The results of the study present a stark contrast to claims made by the Trump administration, and widely circulated by Fox News and other rightwing media outlets, that the US is being overrun by violent leftwing protesters and “domestic terrorists”. “There have been some violent demonstrations, and those tend to get a lot of media coverage,” Dr Roudabeh Kishi, Acled’s director of research & innovation, told the Guardian. “But if you were to look at all the demonstrations happening, it’s overwhelmingly peaceful.” Between late May and the end of the August, Acled and Princeton researchers documented 7,750 demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement in more than 2,000 different locations across the United States, as well as more than 1,000 protests related to Covid-19. About a third of the Covid-19 protests were linked to schools reopening, the report found, all of them peaceful protests. There were also at least 70 documented protests over Covid-19 involving healthcare workers, and at least 37 demonstrations focused on the eviction crisis. While the overwhelming majority of all the different kinds of protests tracked over this time were peaceful, the report did find a troubling trend of violence from both government forces and non-state actors. Government authorities were more likely to intervene in Black Lives Matter protests than in other demonstrations, and also more likely to intervene with force, like using teargas, rubber bullets and pepper spray or beating demonstrators with batons, the researchers found. They documented 392 incidents this summer in which government authorities used force on Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Journalists covering Black Lives Matter protests were also met with violence from government forces in at least 100 separate incidents across dozens of states this summer. One journalist was blinded after being hit in the eye with a rubber bullet while covering protests over George Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis. Violent intervention from government forces did not make protests more peaceful, the report concluded. In Portland specifically, the report found that intervention from federal authorities in the protest “only aggravated unrest”, with the number of “violent demonstrations” rising from 53% to nearly 62% of all events “after federal agents arrived on the scene”. Armed individuals were documented at at least 50 protests this summer. “Individual perpetrators – sometimes linked to hate groups like the KKK – have launched dozens of car-ramming attacks targeting demonstrations around the country,” the researchers wrote.", "output": "left"}

Wednesday’s decision contrasts with the recent ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court, which kicked Trump off its primary ballot because of his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. That decision has been paused pending an appeal. With these dueling decisions, the expected appeals to the US Supreme Court become even more critical, especially as the nation races toward the start of the 2024 primaries. Unlike in Colorado, the Michigan lawsuit never reached a trial and was dismissed early on in the process. An intermediate appeals court upheld the decision to toss the case on procedural grounds. The Michigan Court of Claims judge who first got the case said state law doesn’t give election officials any leeway to police the eligibility of presidential primary candidates. He also said the case raised a political question that shouldn’t be decided in the courts. His decision was upheld by the Michigan Court of Appeals, which said: “At the moment, the only event about to occur is the presidential primary election. But as explained, whether Trump is disqualified is irrelevant to his placement on that particular ballot.” The order from the Michigan Supreme Court was unsigned, and the court did not release a vote count. Unlike in Colorado, the Michigan courts rejected the case wholly on procedural grounds. They never reached the questions of whether January 6 was an insurrection and whether Trump engaged in it. One of the Michigan justices on Wednesday wrote why Michigan is different from Colorado. The anti-Trump challengers “have identified no analogous provision in the Michigan Election Law that requires someone seeking the office of President of the United States to attest to their legal qualification to hold the office,” Justice Elizabeth Welch wrote, comparing Michigan law to Colorado’s election code. The lower-court rulings in Michigan kept the door open to future 14th Amendment challenges if Trump wins the Republican nomination. Welch specifically noted this dynamic in the separate opinion she wrote Wednesday. “I would affirm the Court of Appeals’ ruling on this issue, which still allows appellants to renew their legal efforts as to the Michigan general election later in 2024 should Trump become the Republican nominee for President of the United States or seek such office as an independent candidate,” Welch wrote. The Minnesota Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion last month, finding that an “insurrectionist ban” case involving Trump should be dismissed with regards to the GOP primary, but that the challengers could try again if he wins the nomination. On Truth Social, Trump denounced what he said was a “pathetic gambit” to keep him off the ballot and repeated his unfounded warnings that the 2024 was at risk of being “rigged and stolen.” Ron Fein, the legal director of Free Speech For People, which filed the Michigan case, said the decision was “disappointing” but noted that it “isn’t binding on any court outside Michigan.” Another attorney for the challengers, Mark Brewer, said they would continue the efforts in Michigan. “The Court’s decision is disappointing but we will continue, at a later stage, to seek to uphold this critical constitutional provision designed to protect our republic,” Brewer said in the statement. Ratified after the Civil War, the 14th Amendment says officials who take an oath to support the Constitution are banned from future office if they “engaged in insurrection.” The provision was used to disqualify thousands of ex-Confederates. But it has only been applied twice since 1919, and the vague wording doesn’t mention the presidency. The Michigan lawsuit was filed in September by Free Speech For People on behalf of a group of voters. It also pursued an unsuccessful 14th Amendment challenge against Trump in Minnesota, and recently filed a new case in Oregon. The Colorado lawsuit was initiated by a separate liberal-leaning group. Also on Wednesday, Trump’s lawyers asked Maine’s secretary of state to recuse herself from deciding whether he should be removed from the 2024 ballot because of the “insurrectionist ban.” Maine is different from other states: ballot challenges are first heard by the secretary of state, not in the courts. Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, an elected Democrat, presided over an administrative hearing earlier this month about Trump’s eligibility for office. Her ruling is expected this week, and her decision can be appealed in Maine state courts. The secretary’s office declined to comment on the Wednesday request, but it’s unlikely that she’ll agree to recuse. Trump made a similar request with the trial judge in the Colorado case, but the judge there rejected his motion.

Since taking office, Trump has blocked a number of people for criticizing him or even just cracking jokes at his expense, including celebrities such as model Chrissy Teigen and author Stephen King. However, in May, a federal judge said Trump’s blocks were unconstitutional as his Twitter feed was a public forum which “has been used in the course of the appointment of officers (including cabinet secretaries), the removal of officers and the conduct of foreign policy.” U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald advised Trump to use Twitter’s “mute” function instead and asked the president and White House social media director Dan Scavino to unblock the users. So Trump unblocked the seven plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed by the Knight First Amendment Institute, but not the others he had previously blocked. Although the Justice Department announced in June that it would appeal, earlier this month, Knight asked the White House to unblock an additional 41 accounts. On Tuesday night, that happened ― at least for some of them. Knight is now asking others who have been Trump-blocked to get in touch. Comedy writer Bess Kalb took a moment to savor the victory: Then, newly unblocked by Trump, she turned around and blocked him instead: Jules Suzdaltsev was blocked in May 2017 after urging Trump to spend more time with his son. Like Kalb, Suzdaltsev first basked in the moment: Then, he hit Trump with a block of his own: A few others also celebrated: Not everyone has been unblocked. It appears the action was limited to just some of the people on the Knight list. Others reported that they remain blocked, including longtime Trump nemesis Rosie O’Donnell. It’s not clear if Teigen and King were among the unblocked. Last year, Teigen said she was blocked after writing “lol no one likes you.” King described the moment he was blocked to “Late Show” host Stephen Colbert earlier this year. “I might’ve said he had his head somewhere where a certain yoga position would be necessary to get it there,” King said. “And that was it, man.”", "output": "left"}

The recording indicates Trump understood he retained classified material after leaving the White House, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation. On the recording, Trump’s comments suggest he would like to share the information but he’s aware of limitations on his ability post-presidency to declassify records, two of the sources said. CNN has not listened to the recording, but multiple sources described it. One source said the relevant portion on the Iran document is about two minutes long, and another source said the discussion is a small part of a much longer meeting. Special counsel Jack Smith, who is leading the Justice Department investigation into Trump, has focused on the meeting as part of the criminal investigation into Trump’s handling of national security secrets. Sources describe the recording as an “important” piece of evidence in a possible case against Trump, who has repeatedly asserted he could retain presidential records and “automatically” declassify documents. Prosecutors have asked witnesses about the recording and the document before a federal grand jury. The episode has generated enough interest for investigators to have questioned Gen. Mark Milley, one of the highest-ranking Trump-era national security officials, about the incident. The July 2021 meeting was held at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, with two people working on the autobiography of Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows as well as aides employed by the former president, including communications specialist Margo Martin. The attendees, sources said, did not have security clearances that would allow them access to classified information. Meadows didn’t attend the meeting, sources said. Meadows’ autobiography includes an account of what appears to be the same meeting, during which Trump “recalls a four-page report typed up by (Trump’s former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) Mark Milley himself. It contained the general’s own plan to attack Iran, deploying massive numbers of troops, something he urged President Trump to do more than once during his presidency.” The document Trump references was not produced by Milley, CNN was told. Investigators have questioned Milley about the episode in recent months, making him one of the highest-ranking national security officials from Trump’s administration to meet with the special counsel’s team. Milley’s spokesman Dave Butler declined to comment to CNN. The revelation that the former president and commander-in-chief has been captured on tape discussing a classified document could raise his legal exposure as he continues his third bid for the White House. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A Trump campaign spokesman said “leaks” are meant to “inflame tensions” around Trump. “The DOJ’s continued interference in the presidential election is shameful and this meritless investigation should cease wasting the American taxpayer’s money on Democrat political objectives,” the spokesman added. When asked at a CNN town hall this month if he showed classified documents he kept after the presidency to anyone, Trump answered: “Not really. I would have the right to. By the way, they were declassified after.” A lawyer for Meadows declined to comment. A lawyer for Martin declined to comment. Smith’s investigation has shown signs of nearing its end, though it hasn’t yet resulted in any criminal charges. A spokesman for the special counsel’s office declined to comment for this story. Trump was outraged at New Yorker story on Milley and Iran The recording that’s now in the hands of prosecutors shows they are not only looking at Trump’s actions regarding classified documents recovered from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, but also at what happened at Bedminster a year earlier. The meeting in which Trump discussed the Iran document with others happened shortly after The New Yorker published a story by Susan Glasser detailing how, in the final days of Trump’s presidency, Milley instructed the Joint Chiefs to ensure Trump issued no illegal orders and that he be informed if there was any concern. The story infuriated Trump. Glasser reported that in the months following the election, Milley repeatedly argued against striking Iran and was concerned Trump “might set in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified.” Milley and others talked Trump out of taking such a drastic action, according to the New Yorker story. On the recording and in response to the story, Trump brings up the document, which he says came from Milley. Trump told those in the room that if he could show it to people, it would undermine what Milley was saying, the sources said. One source says Trump refers to the document as if it is in front of him. Several sources say the recording captures the sound of paper rustling, as if Trump was waving the document around, though is not clear if it was the actual Iran document. There’s also laughter in the room that’s captured on the recording. The US military has contingency plans and courses of action that apply to countries and situations around the globe. The meeting took place well before Trump’s team shipped 15 boxes of presidential records and classified documents back to the National Archives and Records Administration in January 2022 after months of back-and-forth between his team and the records agency. The Justice Department later obtained additional documents with classified markings from Trump, seizing more than 100 during a search of Mar-a-Lago last August. Trump’s legal team hired people to search other Trump properties, including Bedminster, late last year. Investigators from the special counsel’s office also have asked in their document handling and obstruction investigation about other scenarios in which Trump may have shown national security documents, such as maps, to others, sources say. They’ve also asked several witnesses to share details about Trump’s anger toward Milley. During the summer of 2021, sources say multiple people were making recordings of Trump as he held conversations with journalists and biographers. Trump’s different explanations on the declassified documents Trump and his attorneys have given several different, often conflicting, explanations for why Trump didn’t intentionally retain classified materials in violation of federal law. Initially, Trump allies argued he had a “standing declassification order” so that documents removed from the Oval Office were immediately declassified. A few weeks later, Trump told Fox News that he could declassify things “just by thinking about it.” Earlier this year, Trump’s legal team told Congress that classified material was inadvertently packed up at the end of the administration. Most recently, Trump told CNN at a town hall that materials were “automatically declassified” when he took them. However, there’s no indication Trump followed the legally mandated declassification process, and his attorneys have avoided saying so far in court whether Trump declassified records he kept.

Getting a guilty verdict in the bulk of the 18 counts against Manafort will impact everything from the politics of the investigation to the leverage prosecutors have over future witnesses and even the legal strategy they're able to execute. Politico's Darren Samuelsohn writes: “The din of the verdict will be deafening,” said Mark Corallo, a former spokesman for both Trump’s legal team and the George W. Bush Justice Department. “If Manafort is acquitted it’ll be the pro-Trump side blasting the special counsel, blasting the whole process, urging for the dismissal of the office of special counsel and shutting down the investigation and all of that.” But if Mueller delivers a lifetime's worth of sentencing for Manafort, the notion that the entire probe is a “witch hunt” will crumble under the weight of the conviction. That will not only give Democrats on the Hill ammunition to continue defending the probe, it will also provide Mueller's team with considerable legal benefits. Mueller could potentially use the guilty verdict to press Manafort for more information in exchange for a lighter sentence. Or perhaps after the Virginia proceeding wraps up in several weeks, Manafort could cut a deal in his D.C. trial in September. Such a verdict would also make other potential witnesses more pliable as they ponder suffering a similar fate to Manafort’s. Finally, there’s the issue of the first Manafort trial coming to a close right around Labor Day, when America comes back from summer vacation and begins to tune into the closing months of the midterm election. Just imagine the escalation in Trump’s already inane tweeting if Manafort suffers a major legal blow in Virginia only to resume his defense weeks later in D.C. While Mueller has already racked up five guilty pleas in his investigation, Manafort's case is the first to go to trial. Last October, Mueller chose to publicly release the charges against Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates before publicizing any others. Even then, most former federal prosecutors considered it a strong case that relied little on testimony and heavily on an incontrovertible paper trail. But since that time, Gates flipped and became a cooperating witness, bolstering the case against Manafort even more. Despite all that's on the line, the proceeding will be covered more like an old-school trial since no electronic devices, recorders, or cameras are allowed in the court room. But stay tuned—one way or the other the outcome of Manafort’s trial will have major implications for Trump’s presidency, the midterm elections, and possibly even the direction of the country.", "output": "left"}

Menendez cashed in by linking Qatari royal family member with NJ businessman NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez used his international clout to help a friend get a multimillion-dollar deal with a Qatari investment fund, partly by taking actions favorable to Qatar’s government, federal prosecutors said Tuesday in a revised indictment. The new allegations deepen the legal challenges for Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, who already was charged with wielding his political influence to secretly advance Egypt’s interests. The superseding indictment in New York said the senator and his wife accepted bribes of gold bars and cash from New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes as a reward for several corrupt acts that included his help securing a major investment from the Qatari fund. Prosecutors said Menendez introduced Daibes to a member of Qatar’s royal family who was also a principal in the investment firm, met personally with Qatari officials and made public statements supportive of Qatar while the real estate deal was being negotiated. The indictment said the Qatari investor eventually invested tens of millions of dollars in Daibes’ development project, in a deal finalized in 2023. Adam Fee, a lawyer for Menendez, said in a statement that prosecutors lacked proof of any wrongdoing. “What they have instead is a string of baseless assumptions and bizarre conjectures based on routine, lawful contacts between a Senator and his constituents or foreign officials. They are turning this into a persecution, not a prosecution,” he said. “At all times, Senator Menendez acted entirely appropriately with respect to Qatar, Egypt, and the many other countries he routinely interacts with. Those interactions were always based on his professional judgment as to the best interests of the United States because he is, and always has been, a patriot.” Tim Donohue, a lawyer for Daibes, said he had no immediate comment. The indictment did not identify the member of the Qatari royal family involved. Messages left with Qatar’s consulate in New York and with its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, were not immediately returned. No new charges were added to the latest version of an indictment that already charged Menendez in a bribery conspiracy that allegedly enriched the senator and his wife with a luxury car besides the cash and gold. The allegations involving Qatar occurred from 2021 through 2023. Other parts of the indictment accuse Menendez, 70, and his wife, Nadine Menendez, of taking bribes from two other New Jersey businessmen besides Daibes. All have pleaded not guilty. Among other things, Menendez is accused of ghostwriting a letter to fellow senators encouraging them to lift a hold on $300 million in aid to Egypt. After his September arrest, the senator gave up his position as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has resisted calls for him to resign from his Senate seat. The indictment contains new details about the relationship between Menendez and Daibes, a powerful New Jersey real estate developer. Daibes has been credited with building out a string of luxury waterfront buildings, known as the “gold coast,” in the New Jersey town of Edgewater. Along the way, he has maintained cozy relationships with local officials, which enabled him to chase off rival developers and renege on promises to build affordable housing, according to a report from the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation. Daibes already faced federal fraud charges when he was arrested in September on charges that he paid bribes to Menendez, a longtime friend. He was also accused of attempting to convince a federal prosecutor to go easy on Daibes in his bank fraud case. The indictment said that while the Qatari investment company was considering its investment in the Daibes real estate development, Menendez made multiple public statements supporting the government of Qatar and then provided them to Daibes so he could share them with the Qatari investor and a Qatari government official. In one August 2021 instance, the indictment said, Menendez used an encrypted messaging application to send Daibes the text of a press release in which he praised the government of Qatar, before texting Daibes: “You might want to send to them. I am just about to release.” Two months later, Menendez and his wife returned from a trip to Qatar and Egypt and were picked up at the airport by Daibes’ driver, the indictment said. The next day, it added, Menendez performed an internet search for “how much is one kilo of gold worth.” The Qatari Investment Co. signed a letter of intent to enter a joint venture with a company controlled by Daibes in May 2022, the indictment said. Thereafter, it added, Daibes gave Menendez at least one gold bar. A search of Menendez’s residence produced two 1-kilogram gold bars and nine 1-ounce gold bars with serial numbers showing they’d previously been possessed by Daibes, along with about 10 envelopes of cash with tens of thousands of dollars bearing the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes, the indictment said. The revised indictment said a Qatari investment official also sent tickets to a Formula One auto racing event to one of Nadine Menendez’s close relatives. The indictment said Menendez did not report any of the cash or gold received by himself or his spouse as required for a U.S. senator on annual financial disclosure forms. Judge Sidney H. Stein, who is presiding over the case, refused last week to extend a May 5 trial date after defense lawyers requested more time to prepare. In a letter to the judge late Tuesday, prosecutors said they would not oppose a delayed arraignment of the defendants or an arraignment by video. ___ Associated Press writers Jake Offenhartz in New York and Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "WASHINGTON — Ukraine wants warplanes. Its allies have plenty. But getting fighter jets to Ukraine is much more complicated than it might seem. On Wednesday, the Biden administration rejected a proposal from Poland that would have made its old Russian-made MiG fighters available to a U.S. base in Germany for potential handover to Ukraine, because it would be a “high risk” step that could ratchet up tensions with Russia, the Defense Department said. The difficulties are legal, logistical and political. Top leaders of NATO — the alliance of 30 countries that includes the U.S. and Germany — want to help Ukraine but have resisted actions that could drag it directly into Moscow’s war against its neighbor. Officials so far have deemed Ukraine's appeals for additional fighter jets, as well as requests to impose a no-fly zone, as moves that would risk direct conflict with Russia. Why did Ukraine want warplanes from Poland in the first place? U.S. or Western European planes are out of the question, because Ukrainian pilots don’t know how to fly them. “Their military is basically built off the Soviet-Russian military, so they operate Soviet-Russian equipment,” said Max Bergmann, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who oversaw international security assistance in his former role as a State Department official. “It’s a bit like if you give someone an iPhone who has always had an Android. And you don’t want to be reading a flight manual while you’re at war.” That’s why countries in the former East bloc that are now part of NATO, like Poland and Latvia, have offered to send their MiG jets to Ukraine in exchange for a promise from Washington to replace them with newer U.S.-made planes in the future. Why the U.S. balked The Pentagon has said that in practice, the trade proposal isn’t “tenable.” Washington has also promised its next batch of sales of F-16 fighters to Taiwan to counter China. Countries sell or give away new and used military defense equipment to foreign countries all the time — the State Department oversees $55 billion a year in sales — and it’s typically the responsibility of the buyer to go pick it up. But Western officials worry that if Ukrainian pilots go to a NATO country to pick up fighter jets and then fly them back into contested Ukrainian airspace, where they might have to engage with Russian fighters, Moscow will view the country they left from as a combatant and therefore fair game. And NATO’s core tenet, spelled out in Article 5 of its charter, is that an attack on any member country is an attack on all, meaning all 30 member states would be obligated to join the fight. “The intelligence community has assessed the transfer of MiG-29s to Ukraine may be mistaken as escalatory and could result in Russian reaction that could increase the prospects of a military escalation with NATO,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday. Some have discussed shipping the fighter jets overland or even dismantling them and reassembling them inside Ukraine. But Kirby said U.S. military and intelligence officials determined that more jets are \"not likely to significantly change the effectiveness of the Ukrainian air force relative to Russian capabilities.\" Experts outside the government have noted that Ukraine hasn’t deployed many of the MiGs it already owns, which makes them wonder whether the country has the complex infrastructure needed to support the aircraft, from trained pilots and mechanics to extra parts, munitions and jet fuel. The losses suffered by Ukraine’s air force in the Russian invasion have been compounded by “years of neglect and underfunding,” according to the Congressional Research Service. “Most of Ukraine’s planes and air defense systems are over 30 years old.” The country’s major air power success seems to have come largely from Turkish-made drones, not manned fighter jets. Russia’s air force has suffered from its own apparent logistical limits; however, it still has more modern aircraft than MiG-29s, which first took to the air in the late 1970s. “The broader thing is that this is probably all just a waste of time,” Bergmann said. “Would we just be putting Ukrainians up in 30-, 40-year-old fighter jets that are just basically flying coffins?”", "output": "left"}

The weapon isn’t yet operational, the sources told NBC News, but Moscow's pursuit of an advanced weapon that could jeopardize America’s vital satellite network has raised concern among U.S. officials, and it prompted the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Turner, to issue an extraordinary statement earlier Wednesday calling on the White House to declassify information about an unnamed “serious national security threat.” Turner, R-Ohio, didn’t provide additional details in his statement. The three sources said he was referring to the Russian effort to field a nuclear weapon in space that could take out satellites that serve as a crucial backbone for U.S. civilian communications, navigation, military operations and intelligence gathering. ABC News first reported that the threat Turner cited in his cryptic statement was about a Russian nuclear anti-satellite weapon. Turner’s statement also got out in front of what the White House said was a planned briefing for congressional leaders. President Joe Biden has been tracking the national security threat and directed White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan to engage with congressional leaders, according to two U.S. officials. White House officials conceded the matter is “serious,” but there are ways to “contain” the threat without triggering mass panic, these officials said. The Kremlin responded Thursday, dismissing the U.S. warnings as a \"trick\" and \"malicious fabrication.\" Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: “It is obvious that the White House is trying, by hook or by crook, to encourage Congress to vote on a bill to allocate money,” referring to aid for Ukraine. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who is Moscow’s point man on arms control, accused Washington of “malicious fabrication,” state news agency TASS reported. Senior U.S. military officers have voiced concern about the threat posed by Russian and Chinese efforts to build anti-satellite weapons, NBC News has reported. Turner said his committee had \"made available to all Members of Congress information concerning a serious national security threat\" on Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, House members began trickling in and out of the highly secure room in the basement of the Capitol, known as the SCIF, where the most sensitive, classified information is shared with lawmakers. Sullivan addressed Turner's statement at a briefing a short time later and suggested he was perplexed by it because a briefing was already planned for Thursday. A U.S. official confirmed that the briefing Thursday is related to the threat Turner highlighted. Biden and the Senate are urging the Republican-controlled House to pass aid for Ukraine in its war against the country, as well as aid for Israel and Taiwan. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wouldn’t bring the Senate-passed aid package to the floor for a vote, saying he wants conservative border security measures added. Turner recently returned from a congressional delegation trip to Ukraine and said Friday that lawmakers “all have access to the intelligence as to the risk that is faced not only to the United States, our allies, but the world as a result of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.” He added, “There’s overwhelming support in the House of Representatives and in the Senate for support for Ukraine.” Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump has faced strong pushback after he said at a campaign rally Saturday that he would encourage Russia to attack NATO countries if they didn’t contribute enough to defense as part of the alliance’s mutual protection agreement. He said he would urge Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to those countries. Trump repeated the story Wednesday night at a rally in South Carolina — though he notably did not mention encouraging Russian aggression this time. \"If they're not going to pay, we're not going to protect, OK? ... One of the heads of the countries stood up and said, 'Does that mean that if we don't pay the bills that you're not going to protect us?' I said, 'That's exactly what it means, exactly. I'm not going to protect you,'\" Trump told the crowd. A national security supplemental funding package, which includes aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, is stalled in Congress. Trump was instrumental in killing a larger foreign aid and border security deal in the Senate this month. Several key lawmakers, including Johnson, said Wednesday that there was no reason to be alarmed by Turner's statement. “I want to assure the American people there is no need for public alarm,” Johnson said at the Capitol. “We are going to work together to address this matter, as we do all sensitive matters that are classified, and beyond that, I’m not at liberty to disclose classified information and really can’t say much more, but we just want to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel, we’re working on it, and there’s no need for alarm.” Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, said: “People should not panic — that is unequivocal. People should not panic.” Turner “is right to highlight this issue, but it’s so sensitive that he is right now not publicly discussing it,” Himes told reporters. “And I don’t want people thinking that Martians are landing or that your Wednesday is going to be ruined. But it is something that the Congress and the administration does need to address in the medium to long run.” Sullivan said at Wednesday's briefing that he reached out this week to the Gang of Eight, the top leaders from the House and the Senate, \"to offer myself up for a personal briefing.\" \"That's been on the books, so I am a bit surprised that Congressman Turner came out publicly today, in advance of a meeting on the books, for me to go sit with him alongside our intelligence and defense professionals tomorrow,\" Sullivan told reporters. He continued: \"That’s his choice to do that. All I can tell you is that I’m focused on going to see him, sit with him, as well as the other House members of the Gang of Eight tomorrow, and I’m not in a position to say anything further from this podium.\" Sullivan declined to provide additional details about the briefing but made it clear that he was the one who initiated the meeting. \"I personally reached out to the Gang of Eight. It is highly unusual, in fact, for the national security adviser to do that, and I did that,\" he said. Asked whether the public should be concerned about the threat, Sullivan said, \"In a way, that question is impossible to answer with a straight 'yes' ... because Americans understand that there are a range of threats and challenges in the world that we’re dealing with every single day, and those threats and challenges range from terrorism to state actors, and we have to contend with them.\" \"I am confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he has taken, is going to ensure the security of the American people going forward, and I will stand here at this podium and assert that, look you in the eye with confidence, that we believe that we can and will and are protecting the national security of the United States and the American people,\" he said. Rep Mike Garcia, R-Calif., said he urges all members to look at the intelligence. “I urge the president to take this matter seriously, as well. And it’s not a political issue. It’s something that needs the attention of members of Congress and the executive branch,\" he said. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., said it is one of several \"very volatile things that we have to address. ... This is something that requires our attention. There’s no doubt. It’s not an immediate crisis but certainly something we have to be very serious about.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said Wednesday, “I think more information will be made available as appropriate, hopefully, sooner rather than later.” Senate leaders aren’t expected to attend the briefing Thursday because the Senate is on a two-week recess. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., and the committee’s ranking member, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., were briefed weeks ago about the national security threat identified by Turner, said two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The intelligence has been made available to all members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Warner and Rubio weren’t given a heads-up about the statement Turner released Wednesday, the two sources said. And while the House made the intelligence available to all of its members late Tuesday night, the Senate didn’t do the same for all senators until Wednesday afternoon.", "output": "left"}

Buying among shoppers rose 3.1% over the holidays compared to the same period last year, according to data released on Tuesday by Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online purchases from Nov. 1 to Dec. 24 across all forms of payment. The data is not adjusted for inflation. Robust spending during the holidays appears to have dispelled concern among some economists of a decline. Their fears centered on a drop-off in pandemic-era savings and a rise in borrowing rates for consumer loans such as credit cards. But a significant reduction of inflation over the past year has delivered some relief for consumers. Strong hiring and resilient wage growth have bolstered shoppers, who account for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity. \"This holiday season, the consumer showed up, spending in a deliberate manner,\" Michelle Meyer, chief economist at the Mastercard Economics Institute, said in a statement. \"The economic backdrop remains favorable with healthy job creation and easing inflation pressures, empowering consumers to seek the goods and experiences they value most,\" Meyer added. Spending over the holidays surged fastest at restaurants, where buying amounted to 7.8% growth compared to the same period last year, Mastercard SpendingPulse data showed. The expansion of spending also grew markedly in apparel, which saw a 2.4% rise. Purchases of electronics and jewelry, however, shrunk compared to the same stretch of 2022, the data showed. Retail sales grew at a breakneck pace online, surging more than 6%. By contrast, the data showed, in-store purchases grew at a sluggish pace of 2%. The majority of purchases took place in person, resulting in the 3.1% overall growth rate, Mastercard SpendingPulse said. The rush of holiday shopping aligns with a burst of optimism among observers following robust sales on Black Friday. Consumers spent a record $9.8 billion online on Black Friday, which marked a 7.5% increase over the year prior, according to Adobe Analytics. Shopper visits, a metric used to assess in-person sales, rose 4.6% compared on Black Friday compared to a year ago -- a rate that nearly doubled the average overall increase in foot traffic this year up to that point, retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions said. A host of key economic indicators marked a good omen for consumers as they entered the holiday season. The unemployment rate stood near a 50-year low, wage growth outpaced inflation and savings remained resilient for upper- and middle-income households. The U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 4.9% over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth in the previous quarter, a government report in October showed. Still, some warning signs threw the fate of the holiday retail season into doubt. Credit card debt climbed to a record high in the third quarter of 2023, surging nearly 5% from the previous quarter and leaving a growing share of borrowers late on payments, a Federal Reserve report last month showed. The growing debt emerged alongside a spike in borrowing costs for loans from credit cards to mortgages that stem from interest rate hikes at the Federal Reserve. Since last year, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate at the fastest pace in more than two decades, seeking to slash price hikes by slowing the economy and reducing consumer demand. But the central bank may soon reverse its policy of raising rates, according to a forecast released after the Fed's meeting earlier this month. Inflation has fallen significantly from a peak of about 9% last summer but remains more than a percentage point higher than the Fed's target. Members of a decision-making committee at the Fed expect to reduce rates next year amounting to three quarter-point cuts, the central bank said. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the exact course of interest rates remains unclear. \"Inflation has eased from its highs and this has come without the significant increase in unemployment. That's very good news,\" Powell said. \"But inflation is too high, ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured, and the path is uncertain,\" he added.", "output": "left"}

And then, she said, she was fired. Cuccia was briefly the chief Pentagon correspondent for the small and staunchly pro-Trump TV channel One America News, OAN for short. A self-proclaimed “MAGA girl,” Cuccia positioned herself as a proudly conservative voice among the normally nonpartisan Pentagon press corps. But she grew perturbed by Hegseth’s actions against the press. In a post on her personal Substack account on Tuesday, she wrote that the Defense Department’s recent move to make vast parts of the Pentagon off-limits to journalists was a “troubling shift.” She heaped doubt on the Defense Department’s rationale for the restrictions. And she questioned why Hegseth hasn’t held any formal press briefings since being sworn in. Get Reliable Sources newsletter - Sign up here to receive Reliable Sources with Brian Stelter in your inbox. “This article isn’t to serve as a tearing down” of Hegseth, she wrote. “This is me wanting to keep MAGA alive.” Evidently, someone disagreed. On Thursday, “I was asked to turn in my Pentagon badge to my bureau chief,” Cuccia said in response to CNN’s inquiry about her status there. On Friday, she said, she was fired. Cuccia declined to answer followup questions. OAN president Charles Herring did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, including about whether any Pentagon officials complained to OAN about Cuccia’s Substack post. Cuccia served in the Trump White House in 2017 and 2018 and later reported from the White House for OAN, then spent several years as a contractor, according to her LinkedIn page. One of her right-wing TV appearances went viral last year when she repeated Trump’s claims of 2020 election fraud on Newsmax. The anchor cut her off, most likely due to allegations being made during the segment. Whether through fiery TV segments or Instagram posts posing with firearms, Cuccia was public about her MAGA bonafides. So she was a natural fit to return to OAN earlier this year. In February, the Defense Department took away NBC’s longtime workspace at the Pentagon and gave the office to OAN — part of a broader push by the Pentagon to seek out pro-Trump coverage and sideline traditional news outlets. OAN suddenly needed to staff the Pentagon, so Cuccia was brought aboard as chief Pentagon correspondent. She personally renovated the office space into what she called a “Liberty Lounge” and chronicled the process on social media. According to her Substack post, she soon grew skeptical of the Defense Department’s dealings with the press corps. Echoing the concerns of the Pentagon Press Association — which Cuccia said she is not officially a part of, since “again hello I am MAGA” — she pointed out that the Pentagon’s top spokesman has only held one briefing since January. “This Administration, to my surprise, also locked the doors to the Pentagon Briefing room, a protocol that was never in place in prior Administrations, and a door that is never locked for press at the White House,” she wrote. “The Commander-in-Chief welcomes the hard questions… and yes, even the dumb ones. Why won’t the Secretary of Defense do the same?” Her nuanced assessment of the Pentagon’s press crackdown totaled 3,000 words. It aligned with the slogan that she printed on tank tops and sold on Etsy last year: “Love your country, not your government.” The primary trigger for her post seemed to be the Defense Department’s May 23 memo restricting journalists from key parts of the Pentagon without an official escort. “For decades — across both Republican and Democratic administrations — reporters have operated in these spaces responsibly, including in the wake of 9/11, without raising red flags from leadership over operational security,” she wrote. The memo indicated that further restrictions are likely in the coming weeks, including a pledge to protect military secrets and tougher scrutiny of press credentialing. “Without press, we by default have to assume that our government relaying information to us, is true,” Cuccia wrote, calling that attitude “the antithesis of what we believe in.” On Friday she changed her X bio to “former chief Pentagon correspondent.”", "output": "left"}

But Joe Biden’s decision to allow his son, Hunter, to travel with him on a 2013 trip to China is a problem for the former vice president. As NBC News reports, Hunter joined his father’s official visit while seeking Chinese investment for a new equity fund he was forming. While NBC says there are no indications Hunter met with Chinese government officials during the visit, it notes that Hunter attended some formal events with his father. NBC also confirms that Hunter’s equity fund received its Chinese license just 10 days after the trip. These things should concern us. First off, even if Hunter had no one-on-one meetings with Chinese government officials, his presence at formal events was of obvious value to his business interests. China is an authoritarian one-party state. Its leaders view access to business opportunity as a reward to those who are loyal and of value to the state. Simply associating himself with his father would have gained Chinese attention and favor. Recall that in 2013, the Obama administration was earning Beijing’s favor by choosing to largely ignore China’s imperial island campaign in the South China Sea and its theft of U.S. intellectual property. Indeed, Beijing would have been laughing at the Obama administration as it prioritized an absurd Chinese commitment to try to reduce carbon emissions by 2030. The basic point is that Beijing would have wanted to maintain these U.S. appeasement policies, which persisted until Trump took office. Seeing Hunter Biden in China with his father doing some personal business, the Chinese would have wanted to ensure Hunter reported back to his father that he had a good visit. Beijing had an interest in opening doors for the vice president’s son. It is thus highly unlikely that it is coincidence that Hunter’s business license was granted just 10 days after the trip. After all, as soon as he stepped off the plane in Beijing to the moment he left Chinese airspace, Hunter would have been under constant surveillance by the Ministry of State Security. Its officers and agents would have followed his every move, bugged his hotel rooms and electronic devices, and surveilled or interviewed everyone Hunter met during the trip. Even if it it didn’t know prior to the trip, the MSS would have quickly found out about Hunter’s business interests. As I say, this is bad for Joe Biden. It is irrelevant that Hunter received a $420,000 financial interest from his Chinese business dealings only in 2017, after the Obama administration had left office. That’s a deferred interest but a significant interest nonetheless. Moreover, was the 2017 payout written into Hunter’s contract in order to avoid media attention towards the vice president? Even if not, why did Joe Biden not check to see what his son was doing in China? When you’re dealing with the Chinese, the lines between business and politics aren’t just blurred, they are often symbiotic. Joe Biden would have known this had he paid even the most basic attention to his intelligence briefings. Fortunately, we can learn more about Hunter’s trip and who he met with. The records will be there: As the child of a vice president, Hunter would have been under Secret Service protection in 2013. Tempered to protective security requirements, those records should now be released.", "output": "right"}

John McCain, R-Ariz., left the nation's capital for surgery on his eye. Over the weekend, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced the scheduled Better Care Act vote would be delayed indefinitely because of McCain's absence.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says the bill, which keeps taxes on investments and other pieces of Obamacare, doesn't go far enough. Moderate Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is also withholding her support because it would slow the rate of growth in spending on Medicaid. \"This bill would make sweeping cuts to the Medicaid program, which has been a staple for 50 years,\" Collins said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" McCain and eight others have expressed doubts about the bill and if they vote \"no,\" it will fail.

Now, that’s not to say you shouldn’t wash your hands regularly or take any of the precautions recommended by health officials that greatly reduce the chance of you getting sick. Regardless, those most at risk are the usual suspects: the elderly and the immunocompromised. A large chunk of the deaths in the U.S. from the WuFlu, which is extremely low compared to seasonal flu, stems from the Washington nursing facility. Yet, this outbreak has done something else. It’s forced airlines to waste thousands on fuel on so-called ghost flights to avoid having their slots handed off to competitors. As Business Insider reported, Europe has a regulation stating that an airline must run 80 percent of its flights to avoid having their slots being allocated elsewhere: Airlines have wasted thousands of gallons of fuel running empty \"ghost\" flights during the coronavirus outbreak because of European rules saying operators can lose their flight slots if they keep their planes on the ground. Demand for flights has collapsed across the globe amid growing fears about the outbreak. Under Europe's rules, airlines operating out of the continent must continue to run 80% of their allocated slots or risk losing them to a competitor. This has led to some operators flying empty planes into and out of European countries at huge costs, The Times of London reported. On Thursday, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to Airport Coordination Limited asking for the rules to be suspended during the outbreak to prevent further environmental and economic damage. […] The International Air Transport Association has estimated that the outbreak could wipe out up to $113 billion in airline sales worldwide. Cruise lines are also going to suffer. In fact, the hurt has been felt everywhere. The circuit breakers were tripped on trading yesterday after the Dow Jones fell 1,800 points at the opening bell. It dipped seven percent. It’s rebounded some this morning, but trillions have been removed from the market as a result of this Wuhan virus that has been overblown to no end. Again, not saying it’s not serious. It is—but context is missing entirely here. This year some 18,000 have died from the seasonal flu, with around 32-45 million Americans infected.

The panel, made up of former senior law enforcement and government officials, warned that if there are not extensive reforms at the Secret Service, then \"another Butler can and will happen again.\" Butler, Pennsylvania, was the site of the first assassination attempt against Trump this year. The Secret Service faced heavy criticism for negligence and sluggish reaction speed. \"The Secret Service as an agency requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission,\" the panel wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. \"Without that reform, the Independent Review Panel believes another Butler can and will happen again.\" The panel's review highlighted key issues both within the Secret Service and specifically regarding the July 13 assassination attempt. The agency had poor communications both internally and with local law enforcement, the panel said. Agents on the ground also had no plan to secure key buildings around the rally venue. \"The failure to secure a complex of buildings, portions of which were within approximately 130 yards of the protectee and containing numerous positions carrying high-angle line of sight risk, represents a critical security failure,\" the report said. \"Relying on a general understanding that ‘the locals have that area covered’ is simply not good enough and, in fact, at Butler this attitude contributed to the security failure,\" it continued. The panel also noted a breakdown in communications. There were two command posts at the Butler rally, one for local law enforcement and another for the Secret Service. Secret Service agents also had to switch radio channels due to an event for First Lady Jill Biden in Pittsburgh. The first lady's Secret Service team's communications could be heard at the Butler rally at the time. The panel ultimately recommended that the Secret Service bring in outside leadership, as well as de-emphasize its role in investigating financial crimes. \"In the Panel’s opinion, it is simply unacceptable for the Service to have anything less than a paramount focus on its protective mission, particularly while that protective mission function is presently suboptimal,\" the report said. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe respond to the report in a Thursday statement. \"We respect the work of the Independent Review Panel and will carefully examine the report and recommendations released today,\" Rowe said. \"However, we are not waiting to act.

Authorities are treating the case as a potential assassination attempt, and arrested a man sources identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Routh was allegedly armed with a rifle when agents fired at him. \"This does not appear to be some random guy with an AK-47 walking outside Trump's club,\" the official added. Authorities said Routh, who had a GoPro camera and two backpacks, shoved the muzzle of his rifle through a chain-link fence and may have been aiming at the president when agents fired at him. Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson confirmed that the Secret Service opened fire after they saw the suspect raising the weapon. The suspect fled in a black Nissan, but was quickly apprehended, authorities said. Trump was on the fifth hole of his course when the shots rang out, prompting his protective detail to swarm him and usher him to the safety of the clubhouse. The incident may prove to be the second attempt on the former president's life in just two months. Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, citing local law enforcement, said the suspect's rifle was discovered in the bushes. Four shots were fired, Hannity also confirmed through local law enforcement. Hannity said Trump's initial reaction inside the clubhouse was to make sure everyone was okay. Fox News host Bret Baier also spoke to Trump, who praised the Secret Service for acting quickly. Trump reaffirmed to Baier that he was fine and there was no evidence any shots were near him or hitting near him. \"Tell everybody I am fine and the Secret Service did a great job,\" Trump told Baier. The Secret Service is working closely with authorities and investigating the situation, and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has been briefed. \"The Secret Service, in conjunction with the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a protective incident involving former President Donald Trump that occurred shortly before 2 p.m. The former president is safe,\" the agency confirmed in a post on X. The White House acknowledged the incident. \"The President and Vice President have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing.

Army veteran Jeremy Todd, who served in the Army for 19 years and injured his spine during a paratrooper training jump at Fort Bragg, called for Cunningham to exit the race after his public relations executive wife, Arlene Guzman Todd, admitted to having an affair with Cunningham, who is also an Army reserve lieutenant colonel. NationalFile.com first reported the affair last week, and both Guzman Todd and Cunningham have admitted to having an affair and apologized for hurting their families. Todd said that Cunningham “chose to repeatedly engage in activities that would hurt his family and a fellow junior officer and veteran.” “If elected, I can only imagine how misplaced his judgment would be for the people he’s charged to represent,” Todd said in a statement to News & Observer on Wednesday, according to Fox News. “I firmly believe Mr. Cunningham should drop out of the Senate race and ask that his behavior and actions be reviewed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.” Although Todd is currently retired, both he and Cunningham served at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, during the same time period — from 2010 through 2016. It is not yet clear whether they knew each other, although a recently-obtained text message from Cunningham to Guzman Todd indicates they have known each other for awhile. Cunningham texted Guzman Todd earlier this year: “Happy belated birthday! Cannot believe he’s 8 years old!!! He was so little when we met!” The Uniform Code of Military Justice prohibits extramarital affairs and the U.S. Army Reserve has begun an investigation into Cunningham. Guy Womack, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and defense attorney in Houston, said if Cunningham and Guzman Todd began the affair when Todd was still an enlisted soldier in the Army, it would be “unconscionable.” “That makes it monumentally worse if an officer is in anyway hurting an enlisted soldier, in this case, having sex with a soldier’s wife,” he said. “That’s unconscionable…that kind of overreaching is completely taboo.” Cunningham is in a tight race with incumbent Sen.

Mike Pence on Friday backed Ted Cruz for president, days ahead of the state’s vital Republican primary contest. The Republican governor announced his choice in an interview on WIBC radio. He prefaced his announcement by saying he likes and respects – and has met with – all three of the Republican presidential candidates. “I’m not against anybody but I will be voting for Ted Cruz,” Pence said. “I see Ted Cruz as a principled conservative who’s dedicated his career to advocating the Reagan agenda.” The announcement is a setback for Trump, who has been barnstorming Indiana – with famed Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight by his side – trying to rally voters ahead of Tuesday’s election and sideline Cruz for good. Cruz is desperately seeking momentum in his fight to block Trump from claiming the delegate majority before the GOP's national convention in July. Trump swept all five Northeastern primary elections earlier in the week and enjoys a massive delegate advantage over his Republican rivals. Cruz has been mathematically eliminated from earning the 1,237 delegate majority, but insists he can block Trump from the majority as well, as the 2016 contest shifts to \"friendlier terrain\" in the West and Midwest. The Texas senator declared he is \"all in\" on Indiana. Cruz said earlier Friday he would \"enthusiastically welcome\" Pence's support. Pence, who faces his own re-election this year, had been under enormous pressure from pro- and anti-Trump factions.

While Pelosi is in no immediate danger of losing her House perch, she’s increasingly becoming the face of a period of Democratic stagnation that’s seen a once-mighty majority systematically deteriorate during her tenure. “I think you’d have to be an idiot to think we could win the House with Pelosi at the top,” Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Tex., bluntly told Politico. “Nancy Pelosi is not the only reason that Ossoff lost, but she certainly is one of the reasons.” As Speaker of the House in 2009, Pelosi presided over a 255-seat majority which was wiped out by the next election, when Democrats fell to 193 seats. In three election cycles since then, Pelosi’s party has netted a single House seat. Those seeking to be part of the next Democratic majority are already seeking separation from Pelosi. Democrat Joe Cunningham, running to unseat Republican Mark Sanford in South Carolina, tweeted soon after announcing his candidacy: “If elected, I will not vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. Time to move forward and win again.” And those calls are coming from Washington, D.C., too. Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., told CNN “we need a leadership change. It’s time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.” Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Oh., who ran against Pelosi in the last leadership election, didn’t invoke his former rival by name, but did by association, saying the Democratic product has grown spoiled and rotten in recent years. “Here is the truth: the Democratic Party has a toxic brand, one that is worse than Donald Trump’s in many parts of the country,” Ryan wrote in a Medium post. Pelosi is in an undeniably tough spot. Her longevity and leadership position makes her tough to unseat; however, it also makes her a target for the more progressive wing of her party that is upset with those in so-called “establishment” posts. And her unpopularity with Republicans of conservative and moderate stripes has made her an easy anchor to tie Democratic candidates to in competitive races. “I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party – and please let Cryin’ Chuck stay!” President Trump tweeted on Thursday, also referencing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The schadenfreude among GOP leaders wasn't limited to Trump's Twitter feed, either. “I hope they keep Nancy for 10 more years. At least another decade,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday. “We have all the ads done. They worked perfectly in Georgia. We know how to run against a Nancy Pelosi-run party.” A source close to Pelosi told Fox News the criticism \"bothers her,\" particularly as it's coming from all angles, as opposed to any attacks she faced after the November elections. “But this is different,” said one source. “Death by a thousand cuts.” One senior House Democratic member told Fox News: “There’s going to be discontent, but it’s more pronounced now. There is some angst about the elections.” Pelosi, first elected in 1987 from her California district, has sought to stop the landslide beneath her feet by emphasizing the positive takeaways from the highly competitive Georgia race, which Democrats poured money and time into in hopes of dealing President Trump a high-profile defeat. In a “Dear Colleague” letter obtained by The New York Times, Pelosi, who has resisted all calls to step aside, spoke of a unifying message “we can all embrace and utilize in our districts.” During a recent caucus meeting, Pelosi also said the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise by a disgruntled Democratic voter may have contributed to the Georgia loss, Politico reported. But the spin being deployed by Pelosi and others in leadership is growing tougher to digest for some in the House. “It was probably one of the more disturbing caucus meetings that I’ve ever been in,” Rice told Politico. “And everyone pretty much sat in silence, and I’d like to think that they were as shocked as I was that they were hearing the spin that was being put on this loss.” Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.", "output": "right"}

However, female ownership still represents a visible minority of overall business owners in the United States and across the globe. The U.S. Census Bureau released a study in 2022 that showed women-owned companies generate approximately $1.9 trillion in sales and are responsible for employing nearly 10 million workers nationwide. For centuries, the business environment restricted women to the traditional role of a wife and mother in the household, with few employment opportunities for educated or non-educated females. However, as the female civil rights groups began to organize in the 1960s-1970s, advancements in culture and politics opened up new opportunities for women in business. WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH: THE THEME, WHY WE CELEBRATE AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW Every March 8, dozens of countries and gender equality activists worldwide have celebrated International Women's Day over the last 110 years.

Timothy Thibault, the FBI assistant special agent in charge of the Washington Field Office, “was not fired, not forced to retire, and not asked to retire,” lawyers representing him from Morrison & Foerster LLP said in a statement shared on Twitter by CBS News’s Catherine Herridge. Thibault’s lawyers strongly rejected early reporting on Thibault’s departure from the FBI that suggested he was forced out and was seen being escorted out of the bureau’s headquarters on Friday. “On his last day, as part of his processing, Mr. Thibault turned in his security badge and walked with two long-time special agent friends through the field office to finish processing his paperwork. He walked out of the building by himself. Claims to the contrary are false,” the statement from Thibault’s counsel said. JIM JORDAN SAYS MORE FBI WHISTLEBLOWERS COMING FORWARD: ‘EVERY OTHER WEEK’ Further, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced this summer that Thibault may have violated the Hatch Act over his social media posts, including those criticizing Trump and then-Attorney General William Barr in 2020. To this, Thibault’s lawyers asserted that “those allegations are being investigated by the Office of Special Counsel” and that their client “is cooperating with that investigation, urges the Office to complete its review, and expects to be fully exonerated.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) demanded in May that the leaders of the DOJ and the FBI investigate whether the official violated DOJ guidelines through partisan posts on social media. Thibault had “liked” a LinkedIn post of a Washington Post opinion piece in February 2020 titled “The Justice Department confirms things are even worse than we feared,” according to the senator. The column repeatedly critiqued Barr’s tenure at the DOJ. The senator pointed out that Thibault also liked another Washington Post column in September 2020, this one titled “William Barr has gone rogue.” The article criticized Barr’s handling of the cases against retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump associate Roger Stone. Grassley showed that Thibault directly posted on his LinkedIn another Washington Post piece in September 2020 titled “Why the Michael Flynn case still matters.” Grassley also said he had found the FBI official’s Twitter account and pointed out that Thibault retweeted an anti-Trump Lincoln Project tweet that said, “Donald Trump is a psychologically broken, embittered, and deeply unhappy man.” The article by the Atlantic, which the Lincoln Project was sharing, was itself titled “Donald Trump is a Broken Man.” Thibault had also been the subject of whistleblower complaints to Republicans, raising concerns of political bias in the upper echelons of the bureau, but the statement from his legal team insisted he did nothing wrong. One whistleblower who reached out to Grassley claimed the agent “ordered closed” an “avenue of additional derogatory Hunter Biden reporting” even though “all of the reporting was either verified or verifiable via criminal search warrants.” Grassley’s office also divulged that Thibault relied heavily on a “left-aligned organization” when seeking approval to open an investigation into former President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign. “Mr. Thibault’s blatant partisanship undermined the work and reputation of the FBI. This type of bias in high-profile investigations casts a shadow over all of the bureau’s work that he was involved in, which ranged from opening an investigation into Trump based on liberal news articles to shutting down investigative activity into Hunter Biden that was based on verified information,” Grassley said in a statement obtained by the Washington Examiner. “Political bias should have no place at the FBI, and the effort to revive the FBI’s credibility can’t stop with his exit. We need accountability, which is why Congress must continue investigating and the inspector general must fully investigate as I’ve requested.” When FBI Director Christopher Wray testified before Congress this month, he said he found it “deeply troubling” when he read the recent whistleblower allegations. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Federal prosecutors are weighing charges against Biden, who is President Joe Biden’s son, for alleged tax violations and for making a false statement in connection to the purchase of a firearm at a time when he should have been blocked from obtaining such a weapon because of a drug addiction. A report from CNN in July on the latest deliberations said the federal investigation had reached a “critical juncture.” The younger Biden has denied wrongdoing. The statement from Thibault’s counsel addressed allegations of certain actions in investigations for partisan reasons, saying he “welcomes any investigation of these false allegations, regardless of his retirement. He firmly believes that any investigation will conclude that his supervision, leadership and decision making were not impacted by political bias or partisanship of any kind. He is confident that all of his decisions were consistent with the FBI’s highest standards for ethics and integrity.” They said Thibault had no involvement in the planning or execution of the recent FBI search for documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and denied that he supervised the investigation into Hunter Biden, noting Wray confirmed on Aug. 4 that it was being handled by the Baltimore Field Office. “In particular, Mr. Thibault was not involved in any decision related to any laptop that may be at issue in that investigation, and he did not seek to close the investigation,” they added. One allegation not mentioned in the statement was Thibault’s alleged role in pressuring agents to “reclassify cases as ‘domestic violent extremism’ even if the cases do not meet the criteria for such a classification,” according to a whistleblower complaint received by House Judiciary Committee Republicans. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the ranking member of the panel, confirmed to Breitbart that Thibault was a subject of that complaint and that the effort was meant to pad domestic terrorism statistics.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a long-anticipated rule to mandate that companies issue reports to investors on the effects of their operations on climate change. The commission voted 3-2 to adopt the rule, part of President Joe Biden’s broader climate agenda, which envisions cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than half, when compared to 2005 levels, by the end of the decade. “These final rules build on past requirements by mandating material climate risk disclosures by public companies and in public offerings,” SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said in a press release. “The rules will provide investors with consistent, comparable, and decision-useful information, and issuers with clear reporting requirements.” The controversial rule was first proposed last March and creates guidelines for how and what companies must report to investors about how their operations affect the climate. It requires large and mid-sized companies to report greenhouse gas emissions — reports that would be audited by an outside party. The rule is significantly pared back from a proposed version by omitting a requirement that corporations disclose emissions generated by suppliers and customers. Still, it is expected to face legal challenges from the industry. Self-reporting of climate information has already become commonplace in business as investors increasingly embrace environmental, social, and governance standards, known as ESG, but the rule would take the trend a step further by imposing reporting requirements. ESG proponents argue that is a way finance and business can help reform society, such as by mitigating the negative effects of climate change. Those who oppose ESG say it distorts the economy and even America’s culture. The Wednesday vote is scaled back from the proposed rule by dropping a requirement that corporations report “Scope 3” emissions, a provision hotly contested by industry. The SEC organizes corporate emissions into three categories, known as scopes. Scope 1 includes direct emissions, Scope 2 refers to indirect emissions, such as those involved in the use of electricity, and Scope 3 measures the emissions of other entities, such as suppliers or customers, in a company’s value chain. Still, even without the Scope 3 requirement, there are some very vocal critics of the rule. The American Securities Association issued a statement Wednesday condemning the move. President and CEO Chris Iacovella said the move showed the SEC “is anti-investor and pro-Wall Street.” “This scheme does achieve one objective; it forces an enormous transfer of wealth from working families and savers to the ESG professional class whose elites will reap windfall profits from the rule,” he said. Will Hild, the executive director of Consumers’ Research, said in a statement that Wednesday should be “considered the darkest day in the history of the SEC.” “With this decision, the commission has mocked its statutory authority, extended the reach of its regulations beyond public markets where it belongs, and applied countless new costs onto the American public,” he said. “It’s also an egregious example of swamp politics.” Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-OH) praised the vote and said it was clear that the SEC responded to feedback from stakeholders in issuing the rule. Brown characterized the now-approved rule as a “thoughtful approach to climate risk disclosure.” “Climate risk, like any other financial risk, is a threat to Americans’ jobs and savings, and to our markets and economy,” he said in a statement. “It’s commonsense to add material climate risks to the list of what we already require companies to disclose and establish a consistent framework for reporting greenhouse gas emissions.” Meanwhile, Brown’s counterpart and ranking member of the committee, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), trashed the rule, saying it exceeds the SEC’s scope of authority and would hurt consumers. “Ignoring the concerns of Americans, small business owners, and stakeholders from across the country, Chair Gensler pressed forward with a final rule that falls outside his agency’s authority and does far more to advance the Biden administration’s far-Left climate agenda than uphold the SEC’s mandate to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation,” Scott said in a statement. Just hours after the SEC climate disclosure rule was approved, several Republican state attorneys general announced a legal challenge to the order. Ten states, including West Virginia and Georgia, which co-led the petition, asked a federal appeals court to strike down the SEC’s new rule as unlawful. “Hoosiers rightly expect the SEC to be focused on protecting investors and financial markets rather than making companies bend the knee to radical environmentalism,” Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said. “This is one more disturbing example of leftwing bureaucrats extending the regulatory tentacles of ESG nonsense into every facet of the economy.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Derek Kreifels, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation, a group that frequently targets ESG, accused the SEC of “backdooring extremist climate policies.” He said such changes would never end up becoming law if they went through the democratic process. “The SEC made itself an enemy of the free market today,” Kreifels said in a statement. “Its onerous climate disclosure rule places an enormous burden on American businesses, large and small. They will be forced to take resources that could have gone to keeping prices low or reinvesting in the American economy, and instead waste them on staying in compliance with a rule that has no business existing in the first place.”", "output": "right"}

It is a Commitment to America where for the last year and a half all the Republican members have been in different task forces going out and working on solutions to the problems.” Approximately 30 House Republicans will gather just outside Pittsburgh at a metal sheet working plant to unveil the long-awaited agenda that represents one of the biggest endeavors Republicans have undertaken ahead of an election perhaps since former Speaker Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America in 1994. “We really break it down into four pillars: An economy that’s strong, a nation that is safe, a future that is built on freedom, and a government that is accountable,” McCarthy told Breitbart News. “Under each pillar, we lay out what we will do. Under an economy that’s strong, we’re going to stop this runaway spending and curb that inflation. We’re going to make [the country] energy independent and lower the price of gas. We’re going to bring back the supply chain from China into America. Under a nation that’s safe, the first thing we’re going to do is secure our border and end this catch-and-release and stop this fentanyl that’s coming across. We’re going to be able to have 200,000 more police officers and the other thing we’re going to be able to do is these prosecutors and DAs that have not been enforcing the law we are going to shine light onto that and bringing out a transparency chart so everyone knows where we’re at. Of course, we’re going to defend our national security.” Under those other two pillars, McCarthy explained the agenda even further. “Then we’re going to look at a future built on freedom.,” McCarthy said. “We’re going to pass a Parents’ Bill of Rights. Parents ought to have a say in their kids’ education. We’re going to supply the ability to have parental choice. We’re going to get tax credits in so kids have scholarships so a million kids can go to new and different schools. You have healthcare in there—and Big Tech, and hold them accountable and ensure fairness. It’s all the things we talked about from the very beginning and all the different things we’re going to be going after from ESG to Section 230. Then, we’re going to be talking about a government that’s accountable. The first thing we’re going to do is defend our rights from the Second Amendment to freedom of speech. Then we go in and what we’ve really been working on already is these agencies that we have more than 500 preservation letters. Why don’t we know where the origins of COVID started? Why don’t we know what happened in Afghanistan when the president listened to the military? What about an Attorney General who went after parents and called them terrorists simply because they went to school board meetings? This is where we’re going to hold the agencies all accountable. The very last one is making sure Congress works. On the very first day we’re going to remove proxy voting and then for election law we have a whole election law bill for voter ID and cleaning up the rolls.” Members expected to attend the rollout of the Commitment to America agenda are a fairly wide-ranging cross-balance of the House GOP conference. Of course, McCarthy and his top two lieutenants, House GOP whip Steve Scalise and Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik will be here, but so will a wide spectrum of House GOP rank-and-file from all sides of the party. The full list of members includes Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Kat Cammack (R-FL), Byron Donalds (R-FL), Tom Emmer (R-MN), Carlos Jimenez (R-FL), Tony Gonzales (R-TX), Garret Graves (R-LA), Brett Guthrie (R-KY), Jim Jordan (R-OH), David Joyce (R-OH), John Katko (R-NY), Mike Kelly (R-PA), Julia Letlow (R-LA), Lisa McClain (R-MI), Mike McCaul (R-TX), Patrick McHenry (R-NC), Dan Meuser (R-PA), Carol Miller (R-WV), Marianette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Burgess Owens (R-UT), Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA), Adrian Smith (R-NE), Lloyd Smucker (R-PA), Bryan Steil (R-WI), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), and Brad Wenstrup (R-OH). After the rollout, McCarthy said, Republicans intend to take the message directly to the voters and use the Commitment to America as a core campaign tool. “I’ve just gotten back from 26 states in the last 43 days,” McCarthy told Breitbart News. “We’re going to keep traveling. We’re here in Pittsburgh, Washington County, because we fundamentally believe we need to get out to talk to the American people; you listen to them, then you lead. We’re seeing an opportunity here that we haven’t seen in the past. What we do is we roll out the Commitment to America and then each week we have different themes for the elements of it. We want people to participate. We’re going to have certain days where we have national commitment days where we encourage people to go talk about the crime. Let’s go talk about the border. Let’s talk about how we make a stronger economy. Let’s talk about how we bring that supply chain back and what would it mean in this economy.” More from McCarthy’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News at the rollout of the Commitment to America is forthcoming.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "MILWAUKEE — Former President Donald Trump finally took the stage at the Republican National Convention Thursday night, speaking publicly for the first time since he nearly fell to a sniper’s bullet at a rally in western Pennsylvania. But Trump wasn’t the only person to speak to GOP delegates at the Fiserv Forum. As they have on the previous three nights, a host of Trump supporters, ranging from former administration officials to professional wrestlers, took the stage ahead of him. Many of the Republican Party’s heavy hitters had already spoken during earlier portions of the convention, but a few unexpected names tried to make an impression Thursday, including wrestling legend Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, conservative media personality Tucker Carlson, and several of Trump’s own family members. Trump’s speech was, however, the biggest takeaway of the night. Trump takes the stage Trump entered the downtown Milwaukee arena as country singer Lee Greenwood gave a live performance of his signature song, “God Bless the USA.” Beginning slowly, Trump delivered an uncharacteristically emotional speech in which he recounted the assassination attempt. Promising it would be the only time he did so, he told in detail what happened, saying the crowd did not stampede after the shots rang out because they didn’t want to leave him. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” he said. When the crowd broke into chants of “Yes, you are!” he repeated, “Thank you. But I’m not. I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God.” Trump had told the Washington Examiner’s Salena Zito that he completely rewrote his convention acceptance speech after being shot, switching from a “humdinger” attacking President Joe Biden to one emphasizing unity. He said he has spoken to the families of each victim, naming them as David Dutch, James Copenhaver, and former fire chief Chris Comparatore. The latter of the three died from his wounds, and Trump kissed a fire department uniform Comparatore had worn before announcing $6.3 million had been raised for the victims’ families. The balance of his speech returned to Trump’s familiar topics of inflation, illegal immigration, and energy independence, layering in his new pledge to eliminate taxes on tips, though his voice remained subdued throughout. While Democrats appear close to toppling Biden as their nominee, Trump mentioned his opponent by name only once. He repeatedly thanked his supporters, saying he would bring back the American dream if he returns to the White House. “We have to make the most of every day, for the people and for the country that we love,” he said. “The attacker in Pennsylvania wanted to stop our moment, but the truth is the movement has never been about me. It has always been about you.” Tucker’s world Political commentator Tucker Carlson hasn’t slowed down much since being let go from Fox News last year. He got a big reception from delegates inside the arena as one of Trump’s warmup speakers and gave a teleprompter-free reflection on leadership that praised Trump for his actions following the shooting. “I reached out to Trump within hours of [the assassination attempt],” said Carlson, who has also worked for CNN and MSNBC during his career. “Having just been shot in the face, he said not a single word about himself. He said only how amazed he was and how proud he was of the crowd, which didn’t run. And I thought two things. The first thing I thought was, ‘Well, of course, they didn’t run. His courage gave them heart.'” The second thought was that Trump hadn’t sought to “inflame the nation” with rhetoric afterward, instead trying to spread a message of unity. But Carlson couldn’t resist a few cracks at Biden’s expense, including in a passage about the meaning of leadership. “Just because you call yourself the president doesn’t mean that much inherently,” he said. “I can call my dog the CEO of Hewlett Packard. It doesn’t mean she is. It’s true. And you hate to say it, but it also is true that you could take, I don’t know, a mannequin or a dead person and make him president. No, you could!” Carlson opined that Trump is seeking to restore democracy rather than subvert it because he gives voters what they actually want. The incredible Hulk and the UFC CEO Professional wrestling icon Hulk Hogan brought his “24-inch pythons” to the area a few minutes after Carlson, dubbing Trump a “gladiator” and his supporters “Trumpites.” Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, remixed the most famous move of his wrestling days by ripping off a tank top to reveal another one reading, “Trump/Vance.” He finished with World Championship Wrestling-style admonition toward Trump’s enemies. “Donald Trump is the president who will get the job done,” he said. “So all you criminals, all you lowlifes, all you scumbags, all you drug dealers, and all you crooked politicians, you need to answer one question, brother. ‘What are you going to do when Donald Trump and all the Trumpomaniacs run wild on you!?’” Hogan was not the only sports world figure to speak, with the list also including Trump National Doral Golf Club General Manager Carrie Ruiz and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White. White pegged Trump as a loyal friend for 25 years, one who would fight hard for the United States in a second administration. “I’m in the tough guy business,” White said. “This is the toughest, most resilient human being I’ve ever met in my life. The greater the stakes, the harder he fights, and this guy never, ever gives up.” Melania Trump makes an appearance Talk had circulated about former first lady Melania Trump’s whereabouts during the convention and whether or not she would make an appearance. She finally did, just after 9 p.m. local time on the RNC’s final night, entering in a solid-red suiting and sitting by vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance (R-OH) in Donald Trump’s VIP box. While Melania Trump did not speak, her presence added to a general subtheme of the human side of Donald Trump, with one of his grandchildren, Eric Trump’s daughter Carolina, sitting in his lap as RNC Co-Chairwoman Lara Trump sat to his side. Several speakers mentioned love and leadership in their remarks. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Ahead of introducing Trump, White read a letter he said Trump wrote inviting him to speak at the convention. The letter included an apology that the gig would interrupt a vacation White was planning to take with his family. “He was concerned about interrupting my family trip,” White said. “That’s the President Trump that I know.

The 39-year-old Page was referring to Trump's comments about her and Strzok at an October rally. During the event, Trump performed a passionate, dramatic reading of Strzok and Page's August 2016 text messages, including Strzok's conspicuous promise to Page that \"we'll stop\" Trump from becoming president. At the time, Strzok was overseeing the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign. At one point, Trump screamed out, \"I love you, Lisa! I love you so much! Lisa, she's going to win one-hundred-million-to-nothing. But just in case she doesn't win, we've got an insurance policy!\" (Conservative commentators have disputed that Trump was mimicking an orgasm.) Page spoke exclusively to The Daily Beast Sunday in a highly sympathetic profile authored by Molly Jong-Fast, who called Strzok \"hawt\" in a tweet last year. In the interview, Page said Trump's remarks had forced her to confront the president publicly. \"I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,” Page said. “It had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.” The interview comes just days before a widely anticipated new report from DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz into possible FBI misconduct is expected to be released Dec. 9. Horowitz has reportedly found that an unidentified lower-level FBI lawyer falsified a key document used to obtain a secret surveillance warrant against a former Trump adviser. In a report last year, Horowitz found that the \"damage\" from Strzok and Page's conduct implicated \"the heart of the FBI's reputation for neutral factfinding and political independence\" and \"cast a cloud over the entire FBI investigation\" into Clinton. But, Page claimed she was coming forward now because of Trump's \"fake orgasm,\" not to get ahead of the new upcoming IG report. “It's like being punched in the gut,\" Page continued. \"My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again. The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world. He’s demeaning me and my career. It’s sickening.” Separately, Page tweeted, \"I'm done being quiet.\" In her interview, Page went on to call the president's remarks \"intimidating.\" “But it's also very intimidating because he’s still the president of the United States,\" Page said. \"And when the president accuses you of treason by name, despite the fact that I know there's no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all, let alone treason, he's still somebody in a position to actually do something about that. To try to further destroy my life. It never goes away or stops, even when he’s not publicly attacking me.” The president's attacks, Page said, affected her day-to-day life. “I'm someone who’s always in my head anyway – so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning,\" Page complained. \"Like, when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro, I kind of wince, wondering if it’s because they recognize me, or are they just scanning the train like people do? It’s immediately a question of friend or foe? Or if I’m walking down the street or shopping and there’s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat, I’ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I’m not looking for conflict. Really, what I wanted most in this world is my life back.” Page insisted that when she was assigned to the Clinton email probe, she knew the \"case was going to get picked apart\" and that \"Director [James] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment. So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer. And so that’s what we did.” However, as the FBI was preparing to interview Clinton at her home at the close of the email probe, Page sent Strzok a text message that suggested she was concerned about the political impact of the investigation. “One more thing: She might be our next president,” Page wrote to Strzok on Feb. 24, 2016. “The last thing you need us going in there loaded for bear. You think she’s going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?” “Agreed….” Strzok responded. Horowitz, the DOJ inspector general, noted in an initial report last year that Strzok and Page's anti-Trump texts were \"not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate’s electoral prospects.” Comey's firing shortly after Trump took office, Page said, was \"totally within the authority of the president,\" but at the same time was \"unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances.\" “It was horrible,” Page said. “It was a devastating moment at the FBI. It was like a funeral, only worse, because at least when someone dies, you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person. He was still alive. But he was inaccessible to us. It jolted the ranks and the investigation. It was so abrupt. He was there one day and gone the next. ... The president fired him with the knowledge that, of course, we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign. I mean, it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort.” Page said that when internal DOJ investigators said she was under investigation for anti-Trump text messages, she had no idea what they were talking about -- and maintained, as Strzok has, that she is capable of separating her personal life from work. “At the end of July in 2017, I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General's office that I’m under investigation for political text messages and honestly, I have no idea what they're talking about,” Page said. “I have no recollection. And initially they’re very coy about it. They don’t tell me much about it. I don't have the first clue what they're talking about. What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair. I’m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators, Andy [McCabe], and my colleagues, now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret.” Last month, the Department of Justice released documents outlining a slew of \"security violations\" and flagrantly \"unprofessional conduct\" by Peter Strzok — including his alleged practice of keeping sensitive FBI documents on his unsecured personal electronic devices, even as his wife gained access to his cellphone and discovered evidence that he was having an affair with Page. Although Strzok claimed to have \"double deleted\" sensitive FBI materials from his personal devices, his wife nonetheless apparently found evidence of his affair on his cellphone — including photographs and a hotel reservation \"ostensibly\" used for a \"romantic encounter.\" Strzok didn't consent to turning over the devices for review, according to the DOJ, even as he acknowledged using Apple's iMessage service for some FBI work. \"[My wife] has my phone. Read an angry note I wrote but didn't send you. That is her calling from my phone. She says she wants to talk to [you]. Said we were close friends nothing more,\" one of Strzok's text to Page read, according to the filing. \"Your wife left me a vm [voicemail]. Am I supposed to respond? She thinks we're having an affair. Should I call and correct her understanding? Leave this to you to address?\" Page responded. Strzok's wife allegedly threatened to send Page's husband some of the photographs from Strzok's phone. Strzok then wrote, \"I don't know. I said we were [] close friends and nothing more. She knows I sent you flowers, I said you were having a tough week.\"", "output": "right"}

Lemon announced the launching of his new show, “The Don Lemon Show,” on X and YouTube following his firing from CNN in April. Lemon claimed Musk chose to cancel its partnership with the show Wednesday which has “changed” his “relationship” with the tech mogul and the platform. “Hi everyone. Elon Musk is mad at me, and I just put out a statement about what happened between him, me and the interview that he is apparently so upset about,” Lemon said in a video uploaded in the tweet. “But make no mistake about this. This is going to be my first episode of the Don Lemon Show this coming Monday March 18 so make sure you tune in. This does not change anything about the show except for my relationship with Elon and X. And there, there’s a whole lot that went down and I’m going to tell you about it in the coming days.” Elon Musk canceled #TheDonLemonShow👀 Watch on YouTube and listen everywhere on Monday March 18. pic.twitter.com/AAhnvcY0ny — Don Lemon (@donlemon) March 13, 2024 Lemon said he believes in free speech and that his show would reach the peak of success on Musk’s platform.

Why is he so upset? Does he even have a reason to be upset?” X Business said the platform “champions free speech” and welcomed Lemon to air his show on the platform in a post.

Musk said Lemon’s approach was to bring CNN to X which “lacked authenticity.” “His approach was basically just “CNN, but on social media”, which doesn’t work, as evidenced by the fact that CNN is dying. And, instead of it being the real Don Lemon, it was really just Jeff Zucker talking through Don, so lacked authenticity. All this said, Lemon/Zucker are of course welcome to build their viewership on this platform along with everyone else,” Musk said.

She says people, you know, politicians are suddenly not in their prime. Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime. Sorry, when a woman is considered to be in her prime in 20’s and 30’s and maybe 40’s.” Lemon apologized for his “inartful” and “irrelevant” remark, and received formal training from the network. Former CNN CEO Chris Licht condemned Lemon’s comment by calling it “unacceptable and unfair” to Lemon’s former co-hosts, Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, The New York Times reported. Lemon told Puck News he has since “cut the cord” with corporate media and shifted to watching a variety of podcasts and shows from across the political spectrum, including Daily Wire Editor Emeritus Ben Shapiro’s show.", "output": "right"}
