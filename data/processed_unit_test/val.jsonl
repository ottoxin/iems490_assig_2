White House aides, in fact, said as much. While Trump didn't explicitly say he would veto the legislation, his remarks suggested that he might. If he does, lawmakers might be able to override his veto, but if he simply refuses to sign it, the bill might die. House Democrats, who had advocated higher direct checks only to encounter Republican resistance in the Senate, immediately said they welcomed Trump's support for sending out more money. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland tweeted that Democrats would try Thursday to pass a separate bill that would send out $2,000 direct payments. Because many members of the House are out of town, Hoyer said, leaders will try to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but that means any single member can kill it. The fate of such a bill is unclear in the Senate. The legislation already passed by Congress included two bills that were combined: One was the Covid-19 relief and stimulus bill, and the other was a large spending bill to fund the government through next September. If the spending bill is not enacted into law, the government will have to shut down Monday. In the four-minute video, Trump trashed the legislation for including, among other things, what he said was \"$85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia; $134 million to Burma; $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment; $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan; $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. Forty million for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art.\" All of those items were in the spending bill, not the Covid-19 bill, which Trump seemed to be conflating. \"This is far more than the Americans are given. Despite all of this wasteful spending,\" Trump added. Congress can't amend the bill now that it has been passed, and it would have to consider new legislation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats had fought to boost the direct payments to Americans in the face of GOP opposition. The nearly $900 billion package, passed with bipartisan support, includes a new round of stimulus checks, an extension of unemployment benefits and more money for vaccines and education. The legislation easily passed in the House — 359 to 53 — before it breezed through the Senate shortly before midnight Monday in a 92-6 vote. The agreement includes stimulus checks of up to $600 per person for individuals earning $75,000 per year and married couples who earn up to $150,000, with $600 more for each dependent under 18 living in the same household. It would also extend unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance — $300 a week — and provide over $284 billion more in loans for businesses struggling to pay rent and workers, $69 billion for testing and vaccine distribution and $82 billion for colleges and schools. Because of the size of the 5,600-page bill and because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers attached a separate measure to avoid a government shutdown for seven days. The Senate Historical Office said it appears to be the longest bill ever approved by Congress, The Associated Press reported. Lawmakers complained that they didn't have time to read through the legislation before the votes. The direct payments would be smaller than the $1,200 checks people received when Congress passed a $2 trillion stimulus package, called the CARES Act, in March to soften the early economic blow of the pandemic for workers and businesses. The enhanced unemployment benefits are also less than the $600 a week provided in that bill, which was the largest economic relief package in modern U.S. history. Earlier, before Trump's attack on the measure, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC on Monday that Americans would begin getting direct payments by \"the beginning of next week.\" Lawmakers had been at loggerheads over a second relief package for months as Covid-19 cases and deaths continued to rise during the holiday season, and many Americans and small-business owners are in dire financial straits. A recent study by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, for example, found that if direct unemployment aid was not extended, 5 million more people would enter poverty in January. The parties worked out a deal that includes many of their top priorities. For Democrats, those included an extension of the moratorium on evictions and targeted funding for underrepresented groups, such as Native American and other minority communities. House Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to limits on benefits for undocumented immigrants and food stamp payments as wins. The legislation does not include hundreds of billions of dollars for states and localities for Medicare or relief for teachers and first responders who have come under financial distress during the pandemic. Republicans pushed for liability protection from Covid-19-related lawsuits for businesses, universities and health care centers, but that was also left out. Schumer criticized Republicans on the Senate floor ahead of the vote Monday, saying more aid is needed. \"This bill cannot and will not be the final word upon congressional relief from the coronavirus pandemic,\" he said. \"This is an emergency survival package, and when we come back in January, our No. 1 job will be to fill in the gaps left by the bill and get the economy moving with strong federal input.\"", "output": "left"}

ROBERTSONAssociated PressThe Associated Press President-elect Joe Biden announced Thursday that he had chosen North Carolina regulator Michael S. Regan as his nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency and New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland as his pick for interior secretary. Biden said the selections round out what he said would be an experienced climate team ready from their first day in office to tackle the “undeniable, accelerating, punishing reality of climate change.” Biden is proposing a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s transportation and electrical systems to cut the oil, gas and coal emissions behind worsening global warming. The picks also help Biden fulfill his promise to put together a Cabinet that reflects the diversity of America. Regan is Black, while Haaland would be the first Native American Cabinet member in U.S. history. Biden will introduce Regan, Haaland and other newly named nominees at an event Saturday. Regan became environmental chief in North Carolina in 2017 and made a name for himself by pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping the low-income and minority communities hit hardest by pollution. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who hired Regan, told The Associated Press this week that Regan was “a consensus builder and a fierce protector of the environment.” If confirmed by the Senate, Regan would take over the EPA after four years that have seen the Trump administration weaken or eliminate key public health and environmental protections. President Donald Trump had made the agency a special target for his drive to cut regulation, saying early on that he would leave only “bits” of the environmental agency behind. Trump rollbacks and proposed rollbacks include weakening air pollution rules for industries, slashing protection for wetlands and waterways and eliminating Obama-era efforts to halt climate change by curbing exhaust and smokestack emissions from autos and factories. Opponents say some of many other rollbacks in the agency will make it harder for regulators to adopt new limits based on threats highlighted in public health studies. In North Carolina, Regan led the negotiations that resulted in the cleanup of the Cape Fear River, which has been dangerously contaminated by PFAS industrial compounds from a chemical plant. PFAS have been associated with increased risk of cancer and other health problems. With Duke Energy, he negotiated what North Carolina says was the largest cleanup agreement for toxic coal ash. Regan also created North Carolina’s Environmental Justice and Equity Advisory Board to help low-income and minority communities that suffer disproportionate exposure to harmful pollutants from refineries, factories and freeways. Regan previously spent almost a decade at the federal EPA, including managing a national program for air pollution issues. Other past work included serving as an associate vice president for climate and energy issues at the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group and as head of his own environmental and energy consulting firm. For her part, Haaland would be the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, the powerful federal agency that has wielded influence over the nation’s tribes for generations. Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, would be in charge of an agency that has tremendous sway over the nearly 600 federally recognized tribes as well as over much of the nation’s vast public lands, waterways, wildlife, national parks and mineral wealth. She tweeted Thursday, “In 4 years, Trump failed Indian Country & only broke more promises. It was exacerbated by the Administration’s failure to take this #pandemic seriously. Looking forward to turning the page on this dark chapter.” Haaland’s historic selection was praised by tribal leaders, progressive activists and Democratic figures alike. Some on Biden’s transition team had expressed concerns about further thinning a narrow Democratic House majority by picking Haaland for a Cabinet position. But the president-elect decided that the barrier-breaking aspect of her nomination and her experience as vice chair of the House Committee on Natural Resources made her the right pick for the moment. Regan was praised for his success even during challenging political circumstances. Republicans controlling North Carolina’s Legislature during the 2010s had eliminated dozens of department regulatory jobs and pushed business-friendly laws. Regan “restored morale in the agency,” said Bill Holman, who led North Carolina’s environmental department. “He renewed the mission of the agency. … He did the missionary work of going to the General Assembly and listening to a lot of critics of environmental legislation, addressing their concerns and finding common ground.” Holman said North Carolina has struggled with how to regulate PFAS industrial compounds, but so has every other state. Part of that has to do with a lack of national leadership on the issue, Holman said, something that he believes Regan is poised to correct by returning to Washington. Holman said, “Regan believes in science, and I think he will put science and public health at the forefront at EPA.” California clean-air regulator Mary Nichols, who earlier had been considered the front-runner for the EPA job in the Biden administration, had faced increasing objections from progressive groups. They said Nichols had not done enough to address the disproportionate harm low-income and minority communities face from living next to oil and gas installations, factories and freeways.", "output": "right"}

The independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee voted 20-0 with one abstention to support mRNA-1273, a vaccine made in collaboration with the U.S. government by Moderna, a decade-old Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotechnology company. \"There's no doubt in my mind – it looks like the benefits outweigh the risks from what I've seen,\" said Dr. Steven Pergam, a committee member and infectious disease and vaccine expert at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, expressing the group's consensus. \"What a remarkable scientific achievement this is,\" added Dr. James Hildreth, a committee member, immunologist and president and CEO of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. \"To go from having a sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement.\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn could officially authorize the vaccine as soon as late Thursday, with delivery to begin nationwide on Monday. Unlike the vaccine the FDA authorized last week, made by Pfizer and its German collaborator BioNTech, the Moderna one will be approved for use only in adults. Moderna recently expanded its research trial to teenagers, but they have not been enrolled long enough to draw conclusions. Pregnant and nursing women, and people who are severely immunocompromised with conditions like HIV, also were not included in large enough numbers to provide clear guidance, although they will not be specifically excluded from receiving the vaccine. A late-stage trial with more than 30,000 participants, half of whom received the active vaccine and half a salt-water placebo, showed the vaccine to be safe and more than 94% effective. Most participants endured side effects like arm pain, fatigue and muscle aches, especially after the second of the two recommended doses. But there were very few serious health events among vaccine recipients and all might have happened by chance, according to the company and the FDA. As it did with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the FDA will stop short of fully approving Moderna's, but instead will issue an \"emergency use authorization\" to speed the process of providing vaccine to the public. The FDA expects the companies to be ready to apply for full approval as soon as next spring, once they have followed trial participants for longer, and have fulfilled a few other requirements. The two vaccines are both made with a technology called messenger RNA, which uses the body's own system of protein manufacturing to make a protein found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. Once primed to see this viral protein, the immune system attacks it when exposed again. The VRBPAC committee spent the first half of Thursday, reviewing company data, hearing from members of the public, and discussing the ethics of when to provide vaccine to the trial participants who received the placebo. They spent several hours asking questions about the data. Moderna is proposing to allow placebo recipients to receive the vaccine shortly after receiving authorization. The company wants to keep as many people in the trial as possible to better understand long-term benefits and effects of the vaccine, but give the active vaccine recipients a placebo, and placebo recipients the vaccine, in a \"crossover\" trial design. Both would be informed about what they got. The company would supply vaccine that was manufactured for the clinical trials, and would therefore expire if it wasn't used soon, so it wouldn't take away from supply designated for health care workers and nursing home residents. While the trial showed the vaccine to be more than 94% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, it hasn't been clear whether the vaccine also would prevent transmission of the disease. Preliminary data Moderna presented Thursday suggested that it will be. There were 38 people in the placebo group and 14 in the active vaccine group who contracted the virus but never developed COVID-19 symptoms, according to Moderna's data. Preventing asymptomatic infection will help slow the spread of the virus, and, if confirmed, will allow vaccinated people to confidently stop wearing masks and keeping their distance. Only about 2% of the trial participants had already had COVID-19 at the start of the study, said Moderna senior vice president Dr. Jacqueline Miller, but the data suggested the vaccine was equally safe for them. \"We think the vaccine can be given to people who have been previously exposed,\" she said. Although several people have had severe allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine – with at least two reactions reported in the U.K. and two in Alaska – Moderna has not seen any severe reactions to its vaccine. Although more data is needed to understand these reactions, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, said it's possible that chemical differences between the two vaccines could explain the difference. Both sets of vaccine makers will be required to follow members of the public as they receive the vaccine to make sure that no new safety problems emerge.

Numerous outlets, including Sky News, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, reported that Buttigieg would be the first “openly gay man” to hold a Cabinet post. Except, Buttigieg would not be the first “openly gay” cabinet member, as that honor already belongs to Richard Grenell, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in February to serve as the acting director of national intelligence. Some of the same outlets touting Buttigieg as the first openly gay cabinet member previously reported that Grenell was the first. The Times in February reported that “Mr. Grenell, who has pushed to advance gay rights in his current post, is also thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member.” The Times on Tuesday reported that “Mr. Buttigieg would bring a younger voice to the cabinet and add to its diversity as its first openly gay member.” Several LGBT-focused news outlets made the same error. Greg Price noted on Twitter that Queerty and Pink News both reported Buttigieg as the first gay cabinet member after saying the same of Grenell earlier this year. Lmao you can’t make it up pic.twitter.com/CVROVYKYFR — Greg Price (@greg_price11) December 16, 2020 On February 20, Queerty tweeted: “Trump makes Richard Grenell first openly gay cabinet secretary in history.” On December 15, the same outlet tweeted: “Pete Buttigieg makes history as first out Cabinet member.” To be clear, Buttigieg is not a cabinet member. Biden has merely said he would nominate him to be one. Pink News tweeted on February 20: “Donald Trump just appointed his first openly gay cabinet member.” On November 9, the outlet tweeted: “Joe Biden ‘almost certain’ to make Pete Buttigieg America’s first out gay cabinet official.” Some outlets at least noted the distinction that, if confirmed, Buttigieg would be the first “senate-confirmed” openly gay cabinet member. Grenell was not confirmed by the senate to be Acting-DNI chief, though he was confirmed by the senate when he was nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. NPR included this distinction when it wrote about Biden’s announcement regarding Buttigieg. “Buttigieg would become the first openly gay Cabinet member to be confirmed by the Senate. Richard Grenell, who is also openly gay, temporarily served as acting director of national intelligence in the Trump administration but was not confirmed for the post,” the outlet reported. Neither the Times nor the Post even mentioned Grenell in their articles about Buttigieg, even though they claimed the Indiana mayor would be the first openly gay man in a cabinet position. The Post, for example, simply said Buttigieg would be the first without any caveats about being senate-confirmed. “Certainly, another “first” — an openly gay man holding a Cabinet post — explains part of the appeal,” the outlet reported.", "output": "right"}

Trump announced the departure in a Monday evening tweet. “Just had a very nice meeting with Attorney General Bill Barr at the White House. Our relationship has been a very good one, he has done an outstanding job! As per letter, Bill will be leaving just before Christmas to spend the holidays with his family,” Trump tweeted. The president added: “Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen, an outstanding person, will become Acting Attorney General. Highly respected Richard Donoghue will be taking over the duties of Deputy Attorney General. Thank you to all!” Trump tweeted a copy of Barr’s resignation letter saying he will depart his job on Dec. 23. “I will spend the next week wrapping up a few remaining matters important to the Administration,” Barr wrote, in a letter that largely praised Trump. “Your record is all the more historic because you accomplished it in the face of relentless, implacable resistance,” Barr wrote to Trump. “Your 2016 victory speech in which you reachout out to your opponents and called for working together for the benefit of the American people was immediately met by a partisan onslaught against you in which no tactic, no matter how abusive and deceitful, was out of bounds. The nadir of this campaign was the effort to cripple, if not oust, your Administration with frenzied and baseless accusations of collusion with Russia.” Barr wrote that “[f]ew could have weathered these attacks, much less forge ahead with a positive program for the country,” and praised various initiatives, including Trump’s record of nominating judges and supporting police during riots and protests this year. The news broke moments after members of the Electoral College from California made President-elect Joe Biden’s win official. Trump recently began expressing frustration with Barr’s Justice Department for failing to bring charges against his political enemies, including Hillary Clinton, for their role in the investigation into his 2016 campaign, telling Fox News he was “not happy.” But it was Barr’s declaration last week that the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud, as repeatedly claimed by Trump, which angered the commander in chief. “To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,” Barr told the Associated Press last Tuesday. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office two days later, Trump accused Barr of not looking “very hard.” “He hasn’t done anything, so he hasn’t looked,” the president said, calling the probe a “disappointment.” When asked if he had confidence in his attorney general, Trump declined to comment, saying, “Ask me in a couple of weeks from now.” Reports began surfacing last week that Barr, 70, was considering stepping down in the final weeks of the Trump administration. A former attorney general under President George H. W. Bush, Barr came out of retirement in 2019 to serve as the Justice Department chief after Trump dismissed predecessor Jeff Sessions.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Electoral College makes it official: Biden won, Trump lost Electoral College makes it official: Biden won, Trump lost WASHINGTON (AP) — The Electoral College decisively confirmed Joe Biden on Monday as the nation’s next president, ratifying his November victory in an authoritative state-by-state repudiation of President Donald Trump’s refusal to concede he had lost. The presidential electors gave Biden a solid majority of 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232, the same margin that Trump bragged was a landslide when he won the White House four years ago. Heightened security was in place in some states as electors met to cast paper ballots, with masks, social distancing and other pandemic precautions the order of the day. The results will be sent to Washington and tallied in a Jan. 6 joint session of Congress over which Vice President Mike Pence will preside. For all Trump’s unsupported claims of fraud, there was little suspense and no change as every one of the electoral votes allocated to Biden and the president in last month’s popular vote went officially to each man. On Election Day, the Democrat topped the incumbent Republican by more than 7 million in the popular vote nationwide. California’s 55 electoral votes put Biden over the top. Vermont, with 3 votes, was the first state to report. Hawaii, with 4 votes, was the last. “Once again in America, the rule of law, our Constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed. Our democracy — pushed, tested, threatened — proved to be resilient, true, and strong,” Biden said in an evening speech in which he stressed the size of his win and the record 81 million people who voted for him. He renewed his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans, whether they voted for him or not, and said the country has hard work ahead on the virus and economy. But there was no concession from the White House, where Trump has continued to make unsupported allegations of fraud. Trump remained in the Oval Office long after the sun set in Washington, calling allies and fellow Republicans while keeping track of the running Electoral College tally, according to White House and campaign aides. The president frequently ducked into the private dining room off the Oval Office to watch on TV, complaining that the cable networks were treating it like a mini-Election Night while not giving his challenges any airtime. The president had grown increasingly disappointed with the size of “Stop the Steal” rallies across the nation as well as efforts for the GOP to field its own slates of electors in states. A presidential wish for a fierce administration defense led to TV appearances early Monday by Stephen Miller, one of his most ferocious advocates, to try to downplay the importance of the Electoral College vote and suggest that Trump’s legal challenges would continue all the way to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Late in the day, he took to Twitter to announce that Attorney General William Barr was leaving the administration before Christmas. Barr’s departure comes amid lingering tension over Trump’s unsupported fraud claims, especially after Barr’s statement this month to The Associated Press that the election results were unaffected by any fraud. In a Fox News interview taped over the weekend, Trump said that “I worry about the country having an illegitimate president, that’s what I worry about. A president that lost and lost badly.” On Monday in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the six battleground states that Biden won and Trump contested — electors gave Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris their votes in low-key proceedings. Nevada’s electors met via Zoom because of the coronavirus pandemic. Trump’s efforts to undermine the election results also led to concerns about safety for the electors, virtually unheard of in previous years. In Michigan, lawmakers from both parties reported receiving threats, and legislative offices were closed over threats of violence. Biden won the state by 154,000 votes, or 2.8 percentage points, over Trump. Georgia state police were out in force at the state Capitol in Atlanta before Democratic electors pledged to Biden met. There were no protesters seen. Even with the Electoral College’s confirmation of Biden’s victory, some Republicans continued to refuse to acknowledge that reality. Yet their opposition to Biden had no practical effect on the electoral process, with the Democrat to be sworn in next month. Republicans who would have been Trump electors met anyway in a handful of states Biden won. Pennsylvania Republicans said they cast a “procedural vote” for Trump and Pence in case courts that have repeatedly rejected challenges to Biden’s victory were to somehow still determine that Trump had won. In North Carolina, Utah and other states across the country where Trump won, his electors turned out to duly cast their ballots for him. Electors in North Carolina had their temperatures checked before being allowed to enter the Capitol to vote. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes withdrew as a Trump elector and was in quarantine because he was exposed to someone with COVID-19. Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated four years ago, were among New York’s 29 electors for Biden and Harris. In New Hampshire, before the state’s four electors voted for Biden at the State House in Concord, 13-year-old Brayden Harrington led the group in the Pledge of Allegiance. He had delivered a moving speech at the Democratic National Convention in August about the struggle with stuttering he shares with Biden. Following weeks of Republican legal challenges that were easily dismissed by judges, Trump and Republican allies tried to persuade the Supreme Court last week to set aside 62 electoral votes for Biden in four states, which might have thrown the outcome into doubt. The justices rejected the effort on Friday. The Electoral College was the product of compromise during the drafting of the Constitution between those who favored electing the president by popular vote and those who opposed giving the people the power to directly choose their leader. Each state gets a number of electors equal to its total number of seats in Congress: two senators plus however many members the state has in the House of Representatives. Washington, D.C., has three votes, under a constitutional amendment that was ratified in 1961. With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, states award all their Electoral College votes to the winner of the popular vote in their state. The bargain struck by the nation’s founders has produced five elections in which the president did not win the popular vote. Trump was the most recent example in 2016. ___ Associated Press writer Jonathan Lemire and AP writers across the United States contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

That is far worse than expected. Economists had forecast 724,000. The prior week was initially estimated at 712,000, the first decline after two weeks of rising claims, and was revised up to 716,000. Many economists think that decline was due to the Thanksgiving holiday, when many employers hold back from laying off workers and some workers do not bother applying for benefits until after the holiday. Jobless claims can be volatile week to week so many economists prefer to look at the four-week average. This rose by 35,000 claims to 776,000. Jobless claims—which are a proxy for layoffs—remain at extremely high levels. Prior to the pandemic, the highest level of claims was 695,000 hit in October of 1982. In March of 2009, at the depths of the financial crisis recession, jobless claims peaked at 665,000. Even when the economy is creating a lot of demand for workers, many businesses will shed employees as they adjust to market conditions. But in a high-pressure labor market, those employees quickly find jobs and many never show up on the employment rolls. What appears to be happening now is that many workers who lose their jobs cannot quickly find replacement work and are forced to apply for benefits. Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, more than ten times the previous record. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and hade made slow, if steady, progress until the election. New restrictions on businesses aimed at stemming the resurgence of coronavirus are likely contributing to layoffs now. Some states and cities have imposed new curfews and discouraged people from leaving home for non-essential reasons. Businesses faced with this suppressed demand will likely be forced to cut their payrolls to reflect lower sales. The monthly jobs report released on Friday showed that hiring had slowed in November. Some sectors hardest hit by limits on capacity and social distancing, including restaurants, pared down their payrolls. Retailers expanded their payrolls by hundreds of thousands of workers to prepare for the holiday shopping season. But because they hired fewer workers than Department of Labor economists expected, this showed up as a contraction in the seasonally adjusted figures. Some of the traditional retail jobs also appear to have migrated into shipping and warehousing as shoppers moved online. Continuing claims, those made after the first filing for benefits, get reported with a week’s lag from initial claims. For the week ended November 28, continuing claims rose 230,000 to 5,757,000. The four-week average of continuing claims was 5,935,750, a decrease of 260,250 from the prior week’s average. In addition to regular state unemployment benefits, the federal government this spring launched two new programs aimed at delivering benefits to workers who ordinarily would not qualify, including gig workers and the self-employed. During the week ending November 21, 51 states reported 8,555,763 continued weekly claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance benefits and 51 states reported 4,532,876 continued weekly claims for Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits. The total number of continued weeks claimed for benefits in all programs for the week ending November 21 was 19,043,429, a decrease of 1,120,049 from the previous week. There were 1,535,274 weekly claims filed for benefits in all programs in the comparable week in 2019. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending November 28 were in Illinois (+8,535) and Oregon (+5,461).", "output": "right"}

Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine were expected to be in place for the start of the immunization program on Tuesday, a day that Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II. The U.K. was the first country to authorize the vaccine for emergency use. In trials, the vaccine was shown to have around 95% efficacy.

Kelly Loeffler repeatedly refused to acknowledge that President Donald Trump lost reelection in November, as she debated her Democratic opponent, Rev. Raphael Warnock, ahead of twin Georgia runoff elections that will determine which party controls the Senate. Asked specifically about President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in Georgia and whether she agreed with Trump’s unfounded accusations of widespread voter fraud, Loeffler sidestepped the matter during a debate Sunday. Although Trump has lost round after round of court challenges in Georgia and other battleground states, and Georgia’s results were certified last month, Loeffler described Trump as merely pursuing “every legal recourse.” She alleged, without any supporting details, irregularities in the November elections, prompting Warnock to chide her for “casting doubt” on a legitimate election in an effort to appease Trump and his supporters. “The people have spoken on the presidential election, and they’re waiting on their senator to be focused on them, not the person in the White House,” he said. The exchange came as a top election official in the state accused Trump and his allies of spreading falsehoods and leading Republicans said they worried that unfounded attacks on the election system could depress turnout in the Jan. 5 runoffs. But Loeffler steered clear of any criticism of Trump, even as she tacitly acknowledged his defeat. Her victory is necessary to prevent a leftward march under complete Democratic control in Washington, she said. “Everything is at stake in this election, the future of our country,” she said, warning of a range of liberal and progressive policies that could never become law if Trump was in the Oval Office. More than a dozen times Loeffler blasted “radical liberal Raphael Warnock” and hammered the pastor as a socialist who would ensure everything from a government takeover of the U.S. healthcare system to the seizure of Americans’ guns. Warnock, who is not a socialist, countered by blasting Loeffler as a self-interested, uber-wealthy politician who “lied not only on me, but on Jesus” by highlighting and, he said, misrepresenting excerpts of his sermons. The battle between Loeffler and Warnock and a second runoff between Republican Sen. David Perdue with Democrat Jon Ossoff will determine which party controls the Senate at the outset of Biden’s presidency. Republicans need one seat for a majority. Democrats need a sweep to make Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The debate came a day after Trump campaigned in Georgia alongside the two senators. The president repeated his baseless claims that Biden’s victory in Georgia and nationally were due to fraud. Georgia officials are on the cusp of completing a third count of about 5 million presidential ballots in the state, with Biden already having been officially certified as the winner despite Trump’s protests. Gabriel Sterling, a top deputy to Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” earlier Sunday that Trump and those echoing him are undermining democracy with deliberate falsehoods. “At this point, it’s a game of whack-a-mole” Sterling said. “They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters. And hell, I voted for him.” Meanwhile, Gov. Brian Kemp and Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, both Republicans, said they opposed Trump’s entreaty for a special legislative session ostensibly to select Republican electors over the Democratic slate already certified for Biden. “The mountains of misinformation are not helping the process; they are only hurting it,” Duncan said. While Loeffler dodged inquiries about Trump’s defeat, Warnock avoided saying whether he’d support expanding the Supreme Court, a priority for some progressives. He said he was more interested in coronavirus pandemic relief, but never answered explicitly whether he was opposed to adding justices. On COVID, the rivals confirmed their confidence in a vaccine and said they’d take it. But they drew contrasts on another economic aid package. Warnock highlighted Loeffler’s criticisms earlier this year of some congressional aid. Loeffler blamed Democratic leaders for Congress’ failure to pass a new round of assistance this fall. The runoffs, necessary because none of the candidates received a majority of votes in November, have put Georgia squarely in the national political spotlight. Both major parties and activist groups are plowing tens of millions of dollars into the state, along with a flood of field workers and volunteers from around the country. Vice President Mike Pence campaigned in the state last week, as former President Barack Obama headlined a virtual rally for Democrats. Biden, the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Georgia since 1992, has promised to visit before the runoff, acknowledging that the outcome will shape the legislative reach of his presidency. Before the prime time matchup, Ossoff debated an empty podium, blistering Perdue as a “coward” for skipping the debate. Ossoff suggested Perdue, whose prolific stock trading has drawn attention during the pandemic, declined to debate because he didn’t want to “incriminate himself” over his personal financial activities that the challenger summed up as “cartoonish abuse of power.” “It shows an astonishing arrogance and sense of entitlement for Georgia’s senior U.S. senator to believe he shouldn’t have to debate at a moment like this in our history,” Ossoff said. Perdue’s campaign manager responded with an email statement that said Ossoff “lost a debate against himself.” The statement did not address any details of Ossoff’s attacks on the senator. Another Perdue aide followed up with a statement emphasizing that “the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee, DOJ and the SEC ... independently cleared Sen. Perdue of any and all wrongdoing.” The Associated Press and other media have reported details of key trades Perdue made after members of Congress began receiving classified briefings about COVID-19 but while Perdue and other officials were downplaying its dangers in public. Perdue’s trades also involved companies whose business activities fall under jurisdiction of some of the senator’s committees. Ossoff brushed aside a moderator’s reminder that authorities have not found any legal wrongdoing on Perdue’s part. “His blatant abuse of his power and privilege to enrich himself is disgraceful,” Ossoff said. “He can’t defend the indefensible. ... The standard for our elected officials must be higher than merely evading prosecution.”", "output": "left"}

Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., asked him to do so during their debate Sunday night. Loeffler brought up how Warnock has supported redistribution of income and praised Marxism in his past writings and asked her opponent to clarify his stance on the issue by denouncing socialism and Marxism. KELLY LOEFFLER AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF DEBATE: TOP 5 MOMENTS \"I believe in our free enterprise system,” Warnock said. He then said that his father was a small-business owner and recalled how he himself helped his church build a community center that helped members “participate in our free enterprise system” during the 2008 recession. The Democrat then attacked Loeffler by accusing her of “teaching the big banks how to hide their investments offshore in the Cayman Islands” and buying her Senate seat. He later tweeted a video clip of his response that omitted Loeffler's question. Republicans were swift to call him out for his indirect response. “Raphael Warnock can’t simply say ‘yes’ when asked to denounce Marxism and socialism,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director Jesse Hunt in response to Warnock's answer. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS SPUR PROBE INTO THIRD-PARTY GROUPS TRYING TO REGISTER OUT-OF-STATE VOTERS “Raphael Warnock just refused to renounce Marxism and socialism. Incredible,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. “Such a lay-up. Tells you how whacked out and radically liberal Raphael Warnock is,” Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said. \"He refuses to denounce these dangerous & radical worldviews because he agrees with them,\" Loeffler tweeted. Loeffler also called out Warnock for dodging a question about court packing. Democrats have often threatened to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court and add liberal justices. This became a hot-button issue when some Democratic lawmakers renewed the threat during the confirmation process for Justice Amy Coney Barrett. In order to do this, Democrats would need control of the Senate so they could eliminate the filibuster and pass legislation.

The report contradicted claims Joe Biden made that he and Hunter never discussed his son’s overseas business dealings. The material reported in the New York Post was reportedly found on the younger Biden’s alleged computer, which was left in a Delaware repair shop. Following the New York Post publishing its initial report, Twitter and Facebook moved to censor the article.

The first alternative is to end quarantine after 10 days if no symptoms are reported, Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC’s Covid-19 incident manager, said on a call with reporters. The second option is to end quarantine after seven days if an individual tests negative and also reports no symptoms. Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak The decision is based on new research and modeling data, Walke said. Shortening the length of quarantine \"may make it easier for people to take this critical action, by reducing the economic hardship associated with a longer period, especially if they cannot work during that time,\" Walke said. It's unclear how many Americans exposed to the virus have complied with the 14-day guidance since the pandemic began. According to Walke, the CDC has heard \"anecdotally from our partners in public health that many people are discontinuing quarantine ahead of time because there's pressure to go back to work, to get people back into school, and it imposes both a mental and possibly also physical burden on individuals.\" A shorter quarantine period may also make individuals more likely to cooperate with contact tracers, he said. Still, the shorter periods do come with a small risk that a person may be infected when he or she leaves quarantine. For the 10-day quarantine, the risk of being infected is about 1 percent, Dr. John Brooks, the CDC's chief medical officer for the Covid-19 response, said. For the seven-day quarantine with a negative test, the risk is about 5 percent. Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Walke noted that a 14-day quarantine is still the best way to reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19. The initial 14-day quarantine guidance was based on the incubation period for the virus, that is, the length of time it can take for a person to become infected after exposure. Even with the shortened quarantine periods, people should monitor for symptoms for a full 14 days after exposure, the CDC advises. Either a PCR test or a rapid antigen test can be used to end quarantine after seven days. The test can be given anytime in the 48 hours before quarantine ends, Brooks said — meaning no earlier than day five of quarantine. Even with a negative test on day five, however, a person still must complete the full seven days. And if the test doesn't come back by the end of seven days, the person must quarantine until results come back, or until day 10. The CDC also issued guidance for upcoming holiday travel, ultimately urging people to postpone travel if possible. However, those who do choose to travel should get a coronavirus test one to three days before travel, then again three to five days after travel. The testing after travel would be combined with a quarantine for seven days. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.", "output": "left"}

A heavily redacted 20-page order and memorandum from Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia from August was unsealed on Tuesday, revealing the existence of the DOJ inquiry. But, due to all of the names and most of the key details being blacked out, it offers the public little in the way of specifics, and there is currently no indication that the pardon that was being pursued materialized. Whether anyone in the White House was privy to such a scheme is also unclear. The inquiry apparently revolves around DOJ investigators seeking access to discussions tied to possible Lobbying Disclosure Act violations and a bribery conspiracy scheme that were not covered under attorney-client privilege. The communications were seized by the U.S. government through search warrants, with the filter team reviewing more than 50 digital media devices, including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives, and computer and external hard drives totaling several terabytes of data, with some of the emailed communications “indicating additional criminal activity.” The communications are related to a “secret lobbying scheme” in which “[redacted] and [redacted] acted as lobbyists to senior White House officials without complying with the registration requirement of the Lobbying Disclosure Act” in order to secure “a pardon or reprieve of sentence for [redacted]” as well as a “related bribery conspiracy scheme” in which “[redacted] would offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence for [redacted]” by using “[redacted] as the intermediaries to deliver the proposed bribe.” A DOJ official told the Washington Examiner that “no government official was or is currently a subject or target of the investigation disclosed in this filing.” Seemingly in reference to the unsealed court filings, Trump tweeted on Tuesday night that the “pardon investigation is Fake News!” The judge wrote in the summer that “the government now seeks a court order’s that the investigative team may access these communications, confront [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted] with the facts recited herein, and take any other investigative steps needed to complete its investigation.” Ten pages of factual background were entirely blacked out. “[Redacted] was neither hired nor supervised by [redacted], and did not report to [redacted] and thus in no way operated as an agent of [redacted]. At most, [redacted] provided merely a coordinating role, including with the [redacted] and the White House Counsel’s office, to help ensure [redacted]’s work on behalf of [redacted]’ clemency petition reached the targeted officials,” Howell wrote in one heavily redacted section. She also said: “[Redacted], not [redacted] requested [redacted]’s assistance ‘as a personal favor’ to use his political connections [redacted]. This political strategy to obtain a presidential pardon was ‘parallel’ to and distinct from [redacted]’s role as an attorney-advocate for [redacted].” It is unclear who specifically the DOJ is scrutinizing. “For the foregoing reasons, email communications between and among [redacted], [redacted], and [redacted], or any agents of these individuals that were sent, copied, or forwarded to [redacted] in connection with the alleged LDA scheme or bribery-for-pardon scheme described in the government’s motion are not covered by the attorney-client or other privilege,” the judge concluded. “The investigative team may therefore review and use any such communications to confront subjects and targets of this investigation. To the extent that the filter team encounters any communications between [redacted] and [redacted] or [redacted], to which [redacted] is not a participant or recipient, that appear to implicate legal advice or representation unrelated to the alleged schemes and crimes described above, they shall be withheld from the investigative team and protected accordingly as required by law.” The possibility of Trump issuing more pardons has garnered more speculation as the president’s term nears its end in January. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump has talked with his advisers about whether to grant preemptive pardons to some of his children — Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump — and to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as to his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani. The report said that Trump spoke with the former New York City major about a possible pardon last week. “#FakeNews NYT lies again,” Giuliani tweeted in response to the article. “Never had the discussion they falsely attribute to an anonymous source. Hard to keep up with all their lies.” Trump has granted 29 pardons and commuted 16 prison sentences during his presidency. Among them were pardons for former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, former Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby, conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, and women’s suffrage advocate Susan B. Anthony. Trump commuted the sentence of his longtime associate Roger Stone earlier this year, and he pardoned retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn last week. The former national security adviser had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017 but subsequently declared his innocence, and the DOJ later moved to dismiss the case.", "output": "right"}

Mike Kelly, who argued that a law permitting no-excuse mail voting violated the state Constitution.

In normal times, Black Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year, drawing millions of shoppers eager to get started on their holiday spending. But these are not normal times: A spike in coronavirus cases is threatening the economy’s fitful recovery from the sudden plunge in the spring. Crowds at stores were dramatically diminished as shoppers do more of their purchases online. Many retailers closed their doors on Thanksgiving Day but beefed up their safety protocols to reassure wary customers about coming in on Black Friday. Stores have also moved their doorbuster deals online and ramped up curbside pickup options as a last grasp at sales before the year ends and they head into the dark days of winter with the pandemic still raging. “Black Friday is still critical,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “No retailer wants it to be tarnished. It’s still vital to get their consumers spending and get consumers into the holiday mood.” Things were quiet at the usually busy Walmart in the Miami suburb of Cooper City, where a small line of people waited for the store to open Friday morning after it had closed for Thanksgiving. The line quickly disappeared once the store opened its doors. Only a handful of people showed up at the Academy department store in Houston but nothing like the lines that typically show up there on Black Friday to nab gaming consoles and other entertainment items. “I’m happy the line isn’t as big,” one shopper said. “That means I can get more stuff. I came out here to get a few TVs, and hopefully, I can get a PS5.” Even smaller stores are taking coronavirus restrictions seriously. Abt Electronics in suburban Chicago will check the temperatures of customers at the door and have up to 30 parking spaces reserved for pickup orders. “I don’t think we’ll have to tell people to wait outside,” owner Mike Abt said. “But you know, that’s a potential and we’ve never had to do that ever in the past. Everyone really wants to make your store look like it’s less crowded, so we’re keeping employees real far away we’re getting people in and out as soon as possible if they want to come in.” Macy’s Herald Square in New York featured such deals as 50% off handbags and 60% off women’s and men’s coats, but there was just a trickle of shoppers at around 7 a.m., an hour after the store opened. There was no one in line at the service area where customers pick up their online orders. Workers could be seen sanitizing door knobs and windows. The scene looked similarly empty at the nearby Manhattan Mall. At the Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, New Jersey, parking spots were easy to find shortly after the mall opened at 7 a.m. Inside, there was a line at video game store GameStop and several police officers to control the crowd. Things were quiet at a Walmart in Saddle Brook, New Jersey. The nation’s largest retailer has been offering its best deals online this month to deter any crowds from showing up on Black Friday. Mike Mitchell went to a Walmart at 7:30 a.m. expecting to see it packed and the doorbuster deals gone, like past Black Fridays. Instead, the lot was mostly empty. What he wanted — a ride-on battery powered Chevy truck for his daughter — was still in stock, even though it was discounted to $98 from $149. “It was kind of surprising,” says Mitchell, who lives in Greensboro, North Carolina. “There was no line. It was very easy.” Several hundreds shoppers were lined up ahead of the 8 a.m. opening at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, which normally attracts several thousand on Black Friday. The smaller crowds were planned, said Jill Renslow, Mall of America’s senior vice president of business development. The mall spread out the Black Friday deals over eight days, kicking them off the Monday before Thanksgiving. Renslow said many retail tenants pivoted more online and added curbside pickup. She said she was confident that many tenants, particularly those that focus on health and wellness, casual apparel and home, will have a strong holiday season. ““It feels good, and it’s the right thing to do to keep everybody safe,” Renslow said “Everyone is shopping a little differently but that’s OK.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has labeled shopping in crowded stores during the holidays a “higher risk” activity and says people should limit any in-person shopping, including at supermarkets. Instead, the health agency recommends shopping online, visiting outdoor markets or using curbside pickup, where workers bring orders to you in the parking lot. At a popular shopping area in Pinellas Park, Florida, several storefronts were empty, and the only line was at a plasma donation center. The day after Thanksgiving has been losing its luster as the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season for the past several years, with more stores were offering holiday discounts throughout the month. Still, Black Friday has remained the busiest day of the year, according to ShopperTrak, and is expected to hold that title again this year. The National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, has taken an optimistic view, predicting that shoppers will be looking for reasons to celebrate. The trade group expects sales for the November and December period to increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019 compared with a 4% increase the year before. Holiday sales have averaged gains of 3.5% over the past five years. “After all they’ve been through, we think there’s going to be a psychological factor that they owe it to themselves and their families to have a better-than-normal holiday,” said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz. Retailers were successful in convincing shoppers to spend early by pushing big discounts in mid-October. And shoppers have shown their willingness to spend for other holidays like Easter and Halloween. Thanksgiving Day hit a new record online as spending reached $5.1 billion, up 21.5% compared to a year ago, according to Adobe Analytics, which measures sales at 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers. Among the most popular items were Lego sets, Barbie toys, and kid scooters, HP laptops, and Apple Watches, according to Adobe. The popularity of Netflix’s “Queen’s Gambit” has boosted sales for chess-related items by more than threefold compared to the previous month, Adobe said. Black Friday is projected to generate $10 billion in online sales, a 39% bump from the year ago period, according to Adobe Analytics. And Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, will remain the biggest online shopping day of the year with $12.7 billion in sales, a 35% jump. The pandemic has already benefited Amazon, which continues to seal its dominance in the online space as jittery shoppers click on their devices instead of venturing into stores. Likewise, big box chains like Walmart and Target that were allowed to stay open during the spring lockdowns fared far better than department stores and other non-essential retailers that were forced to close. That disparity helped speed up bankruptcy filings of more than 40 chains, including J.C. Penney and J.Crew, and resulted in hundreds of stores closings. Department stores and other clothing stores that haven’t yet recovered from the closures during the spring will have a hard time making up for lost sales, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC , a retail research firm. For the fiscal third quarter, mall-based retailers saw their profits down 20% while big box stores and other retailers that operate outside a traditional mall posted a 19% increase, according to RetailMetrics’ tally of roughly 100 retailers. For the fiscal fourth quarter, mall-based retailers are expected to see profits down 31%, while off-mall stores should see profits up 1%. Black Friday proved mixed overseas. Non-essential retailers remained closed in Britain, slowing shopping markedly, with Barclaycard Payments reporting a 13.2% decrease in payment volume compared with 2019’s Black Friday. In Israel, the government allowed additional malls to open to accommodate shoppers. Most malls had been closed in the country since March because of the coronavirus. In a lottery held on Thursday, nine malls were selected to open along with the six that had previously been announced, which filled with customers Friday. Guam, one of the first countries to participate in Black Friday shopping, reported that shoppers mostly followed social distancing guidelines and crowds were smaller than in the past. A struggling economy, leaving customers with less money to spend, has also affected the shoppers on the street there. ___ The Associated Press and UPI contributed to this report.", "output": "right"}

Trump announced the news Wednesday on Twitter as Americans prepared to observe the Thanksgiving holiday this week. It is my Great Honor to announce that General Michael T. Flynn has been granted a Full Pardon. Congratulations to @GenFlynn and his wonderful family, I know you will now have a truly fantastic Thanksgiving! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2020 The pardon brings an end to a long-running legal odyssey for Flynn, who was the only member of the Trump administration to be charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador and then cooperated extensively with prosecutors. But he ultimately reversed course and accused the government of trying to frame him. Flynn went so far as to withdraw his first plea of guilty and substitute a second plea of not guilty, even though he'd acknowledged the underlying conduct that was against the law and been close to receiving a sentence. The pardon drew condemnations from critics who've said Trump's actions to help his friends interfere with the justice system. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for example, who helped prosecute Trump at his impeachment, called the president's actions obviously corrupt. Donald Trump has repeatedly abused the pardon power to reward friends and protect those who covered up for him. — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) November 25, 2020 This time he pardons Michael Flynn, who lied to hide his dealings with the Russians. It’s no surprise that Trump would go out as he came in — Crooked to the end. Flynn, about an hour and a half ahead of Trump's announcement, tweeted a Bible verse alluding to a holy rescue. Jeremiah 1:19 🇺🇸 — General Mike Flynn (@GenFlynn) November 25, 2020 Trump's action on Wednesday may open the door to possible clemency for other former advisers who were indicted as part of the Russia investigation, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman. Justice Department not consulted The Justice Department was not consulted about the Flynn pardon in the way it often takes part in the preparation of presidential pardons, a department official said on Wednesday. The official described the situation on the condition that the person not be identified. The Justice Department did get a \"heads-up\" on Wednesday, the official said, and the person said that \"this is obviously an appropriate use of the president's pardon power.\" Justice Department leaders would have preferred, however, for Flynn's case to have been resolved in court, where federal Judge Emmet Sullivan still had not ruled on the government's request to abandon its prosecution. Justice Department leaders were \"confident in the likelihood of our success in the case,\" the official said Wednesday. Longtime military spy boss Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who once led the Defense Intelligence Agency. He became a security and geopolitical consultant in private life and took tens of thousands of dollars in payments from Russian entities. In 2015, Russia's state-backed TV network RT paid him $45,000 to attend a dinner in Moscow, where he sat at the right arm of President Vladimir Putin. Back in the United States, Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump's outsider campaign in the 2016 presidential race. At the Republican National Convention that year, Flynn led the crowd in chants of \"lock her up\" about Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton. When Trump took office in January 2017, Flynn was rewarded for his loyalty with the job of national security adviser, a post that put him in the White House at the president's side. But questions already were swirling about Flynn's Russian contacts, including with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn was forced to resign after less than a month on the job for allegedly misleading the vice president about his conversations with the Russian envoy. Flynn was interviewed by the FBI in January 2017, just days after assuming his White House post. Intelligence and law enforcement officials worried that the Russians' knowledge about the true facts of Flynn's discussion with Kislyak could open Flynn up to the prospect of coercion, given the contrast with his public statements at the time. Flynn lied to the agents about his conversations with Kislyak, saying he didn't urge Moscow not to respond to sanctions the Obama administration imposed on Russia in retaliation for the Kremlin's election interference. Legal odyssey Flynn pleaded guilty in December 2017 to making false statements to the FBI. He went on to cooperate extensively with Mueller's team, providing \"substantial assistance\" to the special counsel's investigation, according to court papers. Before the Mueller investigation wrapped up, Flynn appeared in court in December 2018 for his sentencing. The Justice Department had said it would not object to Flynn receiving no prison time. Flynn's defense team, however, tried to downplay his crimes despite his admissions and his guilty plea. That prompted sharp criticism from the presiding judge, Sullivan, who said it raised questions about whether Flynn truly accepted responsibility for his actions. Sullivan postponed sentencing to allow Flynn to complete his cooperation, including testifying against his former business partner who was facing charges tied to foreign lobbying. In the summer of 2019, Flynn dumped his legal team and brought on a new set of lawyers led by Sidney Powell, a Texas attorney and frequent critic on Fox News of the Mueller investigation. After the shake-up, Flynn took a combative approach with the government. In one court filing after another, Flynn's counsel asserted his innocence and accused the government of misconduct, withholding exculpatory evidence and other wrongdoing. Sullivan considered Flynn's claims and then, in a 92-page ruling, rejected them all. Then, in January, Flynn filed to withdraw his guilty plea because of what he called \"the government's bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement.\" Prosecutors, meanwhile, repeatedly pointed out in their filings that Flynn twice pleaded guilty before the court to his offense. They also rejected his allegations of violating his plea agreement or misconduct. But Flynn's allegations of government misconduct found a sympathetic audience in Trump, who along with his conservative allies declared Flynn a victim of an FBI gone rogue. Those allegations dovetailed, of course, with the president's own claims that the Russia probe was a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax\" designed to delegitimize his presidency. Ultimately, Attorney General William Barr ordered a review of Flynn's case, and the Justice Department moved in May to drop its prosecution of Flynn. The White House alluded to its and Flynn's latter day framing of his case in a statement on Wednesday filled with overtones about the ostensible conspiracy within officialdom that Trump and allies argue was responsible for the Russia investigation. The statement also included another personal message to Flynn and his family, wishing them a happy Thanksgiving. Sullivan had declined to grant the Justice Department's request immediately to drop the case. Instead, the judge set up a process to examine the department's stated reasons. Flynn's attorneys challenged Sullivan's actions to try to force him to dismiss the case. Ironically, that effort may ultimately have drawn out the process so long that the only way to ensure Flynn was out of legal peril before Joe Biden's inauguration was to prompt Trump to pardon him.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secretly flew to Saudi Arabia on Sunday to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Israeli media said. A member of Netanyahu’s cabinet and Likud party on Monday confirmed reports that the Israeli leader had held a meeting in Saudi Arabia, calling it an “amazing achievement”. Recommended Stories list of 4 itemsExplainer: Where do Arab states stand on normalising Israel ties? Israel ‘normalisation’: Is Saudi Arabia softening its stance? Israel approves first West Bank settler homes since Gulf deals “The very fact the meeting happened, and was outed publicly, even if half-officially right now, is a matter of great importance,” Education Minister Yoav Gallant told Army Radio when asked about the visit. However, Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister, denied reports that a meeting took place between MBS and Israeli officials in a tweet later on Sunday. Sunday’s meeting, if happened, would mark the first known encounter between senior Israeli and Saudi officials, amid a US push to convince Arab countries to normalise ties with Israel. Earlier on Monday, Israel’s Kan public radio and Army Radio said Mossad chief Yossi Cohen also attended the meeting, which was reportedly held in Neom on Saudi Arabia’s Red Sea coast. Netanyahu’s office and the US embassy to Israel had no immediate comment. There has also been no comment from the Saudi government. According to Israeli daily Haaretz, aviation tracking data showed that a private jet had made a brief trip from Tel Aviv to Neom, where MBS and Pompeo had a scheduled meeting on Sunday. Flight-tracking websites showed that the plane was grounded for approximately two hours before it returned to Israel about half an hour past midnight. The jet, according to Haaretz, is the same private plane Netanyahu took several times for his visits to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Normalisation Pompeo has tried to coax the Gulf powerhouse to follow its neighbours, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain, in establishing formal relations with Israel – a rapprochement built largely on shared concerns over Iran. Riyadh has so far declined to normalise ties with Israel, saying Palestinian statehood goals should be addressed first. But the Saudis have allowed Israeli airliners to overfly their territory to newly available Gulf destinations and to Asia. Over the weekend, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said his country has “supported normalisation with Israel for a long time, but one very important thing must happen first: a permanent and full peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians”. During a meeting with the Saudi foreign minister last month, Pompeo had urged the Saudis to consider normalising relations with Israel. “We hope Saudi Arabia will consider normalising its relationships as well, and we want to thank them for the assistance they’ve had in the success of the Abraham Accords so far,” Pompeo said.", "output": "left"}

And so our goal … to make sure that we have a vaccine that was accessible everywhere, I think we’ve actually managed to do that.” The results are based on interim analysis of trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil and there were no hospitalizations or severe cases of COVID-19, The Associated Press reported. Two other drug makers in recent weeks have also announced successful tests of COVID-19 vaccines. A new Moderna vaccine that was developed in conjunction with the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed is nearly 95% effective, according to the company. “The analysis evaluated 95 confirmed Covid-19 infections among the trial’s 30,000 participants,” CNBC reported earlier this month. “Moderna, which developed its vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said 90 cases of Covid-19 were observed in the placebo group versus 5 cases observed in the group that received its two-dose vaccine. That resulted in an estimated vaccine efficacy of 94.5%.” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said 20 million doses will be available by the end of the year, Fox News reported. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer said on Nov. 9 that its developmental vaccine for COVID-19 may be 90% effective at inoculating people against the disease. The rate of effectiveness was calculated by analyzing early data from 94 trial participants in a study involving 43,538 subjects from all over the world. The small early sample means that the protection rate could change by the time the study ends and all the participants are accounted for, according to the AP. A key advantage of Moderna’s vaccine is that it does not need sub-zero storage like Pfizer’s, which will make it easier to distribute. “Overall, if both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are approved by the FDA, the U.S. could have as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available by the end of the year,” Fox reported. “[T]he government could have access to more than 1 billion doses from the two vaccine makers alone by 2021.” But the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper than both of the others. “AstraZeneca, which has pledged it won’t make a profit on the vaccine during the pandemic, has reached agreements with governments and international health organizations that put its cost at about $2.50 a dose. Pfizer’s vaccine costs about $20 a dose, while Moderna’s is $15 to $25, based on agreements the companies have struck to supply their vaccines to the U.S. government,” the AP reported.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Biden To Nominate Antony Blinken For Secretary Of State Updated at 12:50 p.m. ET President-elect Joe Biden will nominate Antony Blinken for the coveted secretary of state post. Blinken, 58, has extensive foreign policy experience, serving as deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama. A graduate of Harvard University and Columbia Law School, Blinken began his foreign policy career during the Clinton administration. He worked as Democratic staff director for the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2002 to 2008, where he worked closely with Biden. He went on to serve as then-Vice President Biden's national security adviser. Blinken is currently managing partner at WestExec Advisors, a firm he co-founded. For Biden, choosing Blinken signals a return to a more traditional foreign policy that favors strong international relationships, NPR's Michele Kelemen says. Biden's secretary of state pick, which will require Senate confirmation, was first reported by Bloomberg News and later confirmed by NPR. In addition to Blinken, the Biden team announced a number of other high-profile foreign policy and national security picks on Monday. Among them is Jake Sullivan, who will serve as national security adviser in the new administration. Sullivan served as Blinken's successor as the former vice president's national security adviser and had previously worked at the State Department under Hillary Clinton. Biden also named Linda Thomas-Greenfield, an experienced diplomat with more than three decades at the Foreign Service under her belt, as the ambassador to the United Nations. If confirmed, Blinken's early work, according to The Associated Press, would be focused heavily on repairing relationships between Washington and foreign governments and allies that have been strained under President Trump's \"America First\" policy, in which long-held alliances have frequently been challenged. Blinken will also be tasked with boosting the beleaguered State Department, an agency that has experienced substantial turnover under Trump, with many longtime diplomats and career staffers leaving. An Office of Inspector General (OIG) report from January found that, \"Workforce management issues are pervasive, affecting programs and operations domestically and overseas and across functional areas and geographic regions.\" A hiring freeze that was ordered by Trump in 2017 and that stretched until 2018 compounded the agency's ability to maintain staffing levels, the report went on to say. \"Employees told OIG that the hiring freeze contributed to excessive workloads, and the lack of transparency about the objectives intended to be achieved by the hiring freeze caused some to be concerned about losing their jobs,\" the report said. Susan Rice, the former national security adviser under Obama, was rumored to have been on the short list for the top State Department job. However, by choosing Blinken, Biden avoids what was likely to have been a Senate battle over her nomination. Rice would have faced criticism over the handling of the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Under pressure that year, Rice took herself out of consideration for the secretary of state's job after Clinton resigned the post. Biden was also rumored to be considering Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, but that choice would have put yet another Senate seat in contention just as Democrats are awaiting two runoff elections that will determine which party controls the chamber. Biden has forged ahead with the transition process after being declared the winner in the Nov. 3 election despite Trump's refusal to concede, subsequent unsuccessful legal challenges in various states where he lost and his refusal to participate in the transition process.

Fox News has confirmed that Republican strategist Karl Rove will serve as national finance chairman for the Georgia Battleground Fund. Rove, who was President George W. Bush’s top political adviser during his two presidential campaigns and in the White House, is a longtime Fox News political analyst and a columnist for the Wall Street Journal. IN GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF SHOWDOWNS, IT'S SOCIALISM VS. CORONAVIRUS Also on the board of the fund as honorary co-chairs are former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Vice President Dan Quayle and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and a potential 2024 GOP White House hopeful, will likely be making a trip to Georgia in the coming days or weeks to campaign with Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Nick Ayers, a veteran Republican strategist and adviser with strong ties to Georgia, and who most recently served as Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, is among the list of national co-chairs for the fund. So is former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who’s also a former chair of the Republican National Committee. The fund, formed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) under the direction of outgoing chair Sen. Todd Young, is expected to raise large sums of money to help keep the GOP’s majority in the Senate. GOP officials declined to say how much money they expected to raise through the new fund. But the NRSC said late last week that it and the Perdue and Loeffler campaigns hauled in over $32 million in fundraising over the previous six days, as they gear up for the Jan. 5 runoff elections. PERDUE LINKS CHALLENGER OSSOFF TO SCHUMER AND PELOSI The current balance of power for the next Senate — coming out of this month’s elections — is 50 Republicans and 48 Democrats. That means the Democrats must win both of Georgia’s runoff elections to make it a 50-50 Senate, in which Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would be the tie-breaking vote, giving her party a razor-thin majority in the chamber. In Georgia, where state law dictates a runoff if no candidate reaches 50% of the vote, Perdue narrowly missed avoiding a runoff. He currently stands at 49.75% in the count, with nearly all votes counted. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff, trails by roughly 87,000 votes. In the other race, Loeffler captured nearly 26% of the vote in a whopping 20-candidate special election to fill the final two years of the term of former GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson. Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock won nearly 33% of the vote. News of the fund was first reported by Politico.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "US election: Trump says Biden won but again refuses to concede Donald Trump has insisted he is not conceding the US election, despite seemingly acknowledging for the first time that Democrat Joe Biden won. \"He won because the Election was Rigged,\" the Republican president wrote on Twitter, repeating unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. About an hour later he said he was not conceding the 3 November vote. He has launched a slew of lawsuits in key states, but has not provided any evidence to back his claims of fraud. On Friday, election officials said the vote was the \"most secure in American history\" and there was \"no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised\". Meanwhile, Mr Biden remains president-elect. The Democrat has 306 votes in the electoral college - the system the US uses to choose its president - which far exceeds the 270 threshold to win. Any recounts or legal challenges are not expected to overturn the overall result. Mr Biden's lead in the popular vote has also surpassed five million. Nevertheless, Mr Trump had refused to acknowledge Mr Biden's victory until - apparently - now. In a news conference on Friday, Mr Trump said \"who knows\" which administration would be in power in the future. His refusal to concede has heightened concerns about the US government's ability, going forward, to tackle growing Covid-19 infection rates. Is this as close as Trump will get to conceding? Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Washington DC Some Biden supporters consider the president's comments amounted to a form of concession, although it was far from unqualified. \"He won\", began President Trump's initial tweet, before descending into his customary slew of unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud. Mr Biden won, continued the president, because there were \"no vote watchers or observers allowed\", repeating his claims of a conspiracy led by the left and the media - while still presenting no evidence. Indeed, within a couple of hours, he contradicted his \"He won\" comment with another tweet, which read: \"He only won in the eyes of the fake news media, I concede nothing.\" In essence, that is about as far as President Trump is likely to go. Even if he eventually acknowledges he won't be president from 20 January, he will probably never relinquish his unsubstantiated claims that he was beaten in a fraudulent vote. Twitter added warnings to Mr Trump's latest allegations of wrongdoing on Sunday, saying: \"This claim of election fraud is disputed.\" The Trump campaign has launched a series of lawsuits saying Republican poll watchers were wrongly denied access to observe the counting of ballots in key battleground states. Election officials have denied this and insisted rules were followed. Most of the lawsuits have been dismissed over lack of evidence. However, thousands of Mr Trump's supporters protested in Washington DC on Saturday to back his appeals. Flag-carrying demonstrators were joined by members of far-right groups including the Proud Boys, some wearing helmets and bullet-proof vests. The largely peaceful demonstration saw some violence later in the evening, as Trump supporters and counter-protesters clashed in several skirmishes. Officials said 20 people had been arrested on a variety of charges, including assault and weapons possession. One stabbing was reported. Two police officers were also injured. Mr Trump's refusal to concede has stalled the normal handover process to the new government, ahead of the 20 January inauguration. The General Services Administration (GSA), the government agency tasked with beginning the process, has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. The Biden team have not been given access to classified security briefings, federal agencies and funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Speaking to NBC on Sunday, Mr Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the process needed to begin this week to allow the country to focus on tackling the coronavirus pandemic. The US is grappling with some of its worst Covid-19 infection rates since the pandemic began, with more than 180,000 new cases and 1,400 deaths on Friday. The country also has the highest number of infections and deaths in the world, with more than 10.9m cases since the pandemic began. \"Joe Biden's going to become president of the United States in the midst of an ongoing crisis,\" said Mr Klain. \"That has to be a seamless transition.\" Leading US infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, echoed his comments, saying it would be better for public health if the transition began immediately. Mr Klain also dismissed Mr Trump's latest conflicting comments on social media. \"Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president\", he said. \"The American people did that.\"", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "US election 2020: Five viral vote claims fact-checked As President Trump continues to dispute the result of the US election, false or misleading posts have been spreading on social media about the vote. Some have been amplified by President Trump and his team, who have called into question the integrity of the election without providing evidence. We've checked some of the main claims. Dead people can't vote: Michigan rumour debunked Viral tweets alleged that dead people were casting votes in the key state of Michigan, adding to a Trump-led chorus of unproven \"voter fraud\" claims. Michigan authorities have hit back, calling the rumours \"misinformation\" - and noting that votes from dead people are rejected. The viral tweets supposedly identified people who had cast an absentee ballot despite being born at the turn of the century and having passed away. One of the men in the posts seems to have been mixed up with his father, now deceased. The men had the same name and address, according to the Politifact website. Local officials in Michigan told the site that the son's ballot was erroneously attributed to the father on the official voting system. We've seen other isolated cases of allegations of \"dead people\" voting - most also explained by family members with the same name, or technical hitches, such as voters being instructed to enter a dummy date of birth if they can't initially find their voter registration record online. The rumours have been repeated by influential accounts, including those of the president's son Don Jr - who of course also shares a name with his father - and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage. No evidence for computer software glitch in Michigan Posts are being widely shared online suggesting a glitch in the vote counting software used in Michigan led to thousands of ballots cast for Donald Trump being counted for Joe Biden. The claims have made their way onto the president's Twitter - retweeting Republican Senator Ted Cruz suggesting there could be a problem with the software used across the state. There was a problem in one county where votes were initially incorrectly reported for Mr Biden, which Michigan's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said \"was quickly identified and corrected\". She added the initial mistake was a human error, not a software error. Viral posts currently circulating claim there could be the same issue in 47 other counties in Michigan where the same software is used. Mrs Benson said: \"There is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state.\" 'Sharpie' votes still count in Arizona Another widespread rumour emerged during the count in the battleground state of Arizona. Tweets alleged there was a scheme to discount votes in pro-Republican parts of the state by distributing Sharpie pens - permanent markers - for people to fill in their ballots. In one widely circulated video, a woman describes how voting machines supposedly can't read ballots marked with this type of pen. The person behind the camera says votes aren't being counted and that people are being forced to use Sharpie pens to skew the vote total. This led to a surge of activity on social media, claims of voter fraud and that large numbers of votes from Trump supporters were being invalidated. CNN reported that a group of protesters that gathered in Maricopa County in Arizona were \"shouting about the sharpie social media misinformation.\" But the claims are false. Maricopa County officials said Sharpies do not invalidate ballots. The Arizona secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, confirmed on Twitter that if you voted in person \"your ballot will be counted, no matter what kind of pen you used (even a Sharpie)!\". Allow X content? Ms Hobbs later told CNN \"even if the machines can't read them for some reason, a marker bled through to the other side, we have ways to count them. They're going to be counted. There is absolutely no merit to saying that this was some conspiracy to invalidate Republican ballots.\" Erroneous Michigan vote map A map of voting in Michigan from the election night - which shows a sudden increase of around 130,000 votes for Joe Biden, but none for Mr Trump - has gone viral on social media. President Trump has tweeted the image, which is raising speculation about voter fraud. It's commonplace that state authorities will add a big chunk of votes to a tally at once. But social media users were questioning why Mr Trump didn't have any votes added to his tally in this particular update. The explanation is simple - it was a data entry error that was later corrected. Decision Desk, the election monitoring website which created the map, said: \"It was a simple error from a file created by the state that we ingested… the state noticed the error and produced an updated count.\" The spokesperson added: \"This sort of thing can happen on election night and we expect other vote tabulators in Michigan experienced this error and corrected in real-time like we did.\" Twitter has added labels to the tweets that raised suspicions, saying: \"Some or all of the content shared in this tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process.\" Matt Mackowiak, the user whose post was picked up by Mr Trump, has deleted the tweet and apologised - although the image remains widely shared elsewhere. Allow X content? In the early hours of Wednesday, the map was propelled by supporters of the pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon and to a wider audience by conservative influencers online. When we contacted Michigan's Bureau of Elections, they said they didn't have a comment on the data discrepancy, but said the results were at this stage \"unofficial\" and not the final count. Wisconsin did not have more ballots than registered voters There have been widespread false claims that more people in Wisconsin voted than were registered. A user tweeted: \"BREAKING: Wisconsin has more votes than people who are registered to vote. Total number of registered voters: 3,129,000. Total number of votes cast: 3,239,920. This is direct evidence of fraud.\" However, this number of registered voters is outdated - the latest figure as of 1 November is 3,684,726. That tweet has now been deleted, but people on Facebook and Twitter continue to share a screenshot of the post. Voter turnout for Wisconsin is significantly higher at this election than in previous years. The state also allows people to register to vote on election day itself, which means the overall number of registered voters could be even higher than the current reported figure.", "output": "center"}

Chuck Schumer, “I gather she and the Democratic leader in the Senate still are looking at something dramatically larger. That’s not a place I think we’re willing to go.” Pelosi and Schumer signaled during a news conference earlier on Thursday they’re not willing to change their call for a large coronavirus package even as efforts to negotiate remain stalled. The Democratic leaders instead argued that the result of the presidential election was a mandate for Joe Biden, which in turn strengthens their position in an effort to get a Covid package in the lame duck session. “This election was maybe more a referendum on who can handle Covid well than anything else,” Schumer said. “The Donald Trump approach was repudiated. The Joe Biden approach was embraced and that’s why we think there’s a better chance to get a bill in the lame duck, if only the Republicans would stop embracing the ridiculous shenanigans that Trump is forcing them to do in the election and focus on what people need.” “We’re at the same place, even more so with the pandemic,” Pelosi said in response to a question if her position on a stimulus has changed from before the election. Pelosi said the priority must be addressing the pandemic, and called on Republicans to “stop this circus and get to work on what really matters to the American people – their health and their economic security.” The criticism from Democrats comes as efforts to negotiate a new relief bill remain stuck as Democrats call for a large-scale, comprehensive approach to a new stimulus with Republicans calling for a targeted approach. McConnell signaled, however, that he does think there needs to be another relief package. “I do think there needs to another package,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “Hopefully we can get past the impasse we’ve had now for four or five months, and get serious about doing something that’s appropriate.” Earlier in the week, McConnell again indicated that Republicans and Democrats remain far apart on a potential new coronavirus stimulus package, saying on Tuesday, “I don’t think the current situation demands a multi-trillion dollar package” and “it seems to me that snag that hung us up for months is still there.” CNN’s Sarah Fortinsky and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

The White House and Trump political appointees have told government officials not to begin working with the Biden transition team until the General Services Administration (GSA) makes its official ascertainment that Biden has won the election, according to reports. This certification opens up funds, lets the incoming administration move into government offices, allows members of the transition team to get intelligence reports and more. But the GSA has yet to officially determine that Biden is the winner of the election, a decision which a spokesperson defended as consistent with precedent established during the 2000 Bush-Gore legal fight. BIDEN TRANSITION HANGS IN LIMBO, AWAITING GSA CERTIFICATION Members of the Biden legal team, however, disputed the GSA's characterization of the status of the current election and panned the refusal to concede from Trump and his backers. \"For somebody to judge how this is done in the past, they should look to the past and with the exception of Florida 2000, which is a very bad example, I think, as you well know, certainly not at all analogous to this situation,\" Biden legal adviser Bob Bauer said Tuesday. \"The ascertainment, as it's called, would have been done by now.\" Added Biden campaign General Counsel Dana Remus: \"I think that there's every indication from every corner that President Trump, his campaign, his allies are trying everything to interfere with the inevitable. But we are pushing forward and we are confident that the inevitable is a very successful administration.\" LIVE UPDATES: GEORGIA SENATE RACEA ATTRACTS NATIONAL ATTENTION Trump, meanwhile, continues to reiterate \"WE WILL WIN!\" on Twitter and added Tuesday, \"People will not accept this Rigged Election!\" After Biden declared victory Saturday when several news organizations, including Fox News, called Pennsylvania in his favor, Trump released a statement saying Biden \"is rushing to falsely pose as the winner.\" \"The simple fact is this election is far from over. Joe Biden has not been certified as the winner of any states, let alone any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts, or states where our campaign has valid and legitimate legal challenges that could determine the ultimate victor,\" Trump added in the statement. Despite a number of suits filed in multiple states by the Trump team, there is almost no chance that the legal strategy could achieve a positive electoral result for the president. Even if some improper votes are found and thrown out, based on the history of past legal challenges and recounts, it would be nearly impossible for such challenges to disqualify so many votes that it closes the gaps Biden leads by in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and others. WHO WILL BIDEN'S CABINET PICKS BE? HERE ARE SOME LEADING CONTENDERS The Trump campaign, for example, was in court Tuesday arguing to throw out fewer than 600 ballots in Montgomery County, Pa., on technicalities. When asked by a judge if there is any evidence of \"fraud\" or \"undue influence\" in those votes, the Trump lawyer replied that there was not -- just that the ballots were improperly filled out and should be disqualified. Biden leads by more than 47,000 votes in Pennsylvania. The fact the GSA has not yet officially ascertained that Biden will win the presidential election, which was called by the Fox News Decision Desk on Saturday, has not completely stalled the presidential transition. The Biden team is forging ahead with what it can do, it says, though it warns that delaying the Biden transition team's access to official government resources like intelligence reports could harm national security.

The helicopter belonged to the Multinational Force and Observers, an independent international peacekeeping body known as MFO, which monitors the 40-year-old peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. The MFO originally said six U.S. service members had died but later said one of the six had survived. \"During a routine mission in the vicinity of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, nine members of the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) were involved in a helicopter crash,\" the MFO said in a statement. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller confirmed that Americans had been killed and said in a statement that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the deaths. \"Yesterday we recognized the sacrifice of millions of American veterans who have defended our nation for generations, and today we are tragically reminded of the last full measure our uniformed warriors may pay for their service,\" he said. \"I extend the Department’s condolences to the families, friends and teammates of these service members.” The Czech Defence Ministry released a statement confirming a Czech army member was among those killed in the helicopter crash. The statement said the cause of the crash was a technical fault. The MFO, an internationally recognized observer mission, said one U.S. member survived. The victims' names are being withheld while their families are informed. \"At this point, there is no information to indicate the crash was anything except an accident,\" the MFO said. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics \"I send my sincere condolences to the families of those killed and wish a speedy recovery to the wounded,\" Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"The contribution of the Multinational Force and Observers to maintaining security and stability in the region is extremely important, and I would like to express my gratitude to the countries that are contributing to the security and peace between Israel and Egypt.\" A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces told NBC News that Israel had offered to help evacuate the wounded and that specialized medical teams could be mobilized if needed. An injured American was taken by helicopter to an Israeli hospital for medical treatment, they added. According to its website, the MFO has 1,154 military personnel from the U.S. and 12 other countries covering an area of more than 3,860 square miles in the Sinai. Some 452 of its personnel are American. In recent years, Washington has been assessing to what extent the U.S. should participate in the MFO, especially as military coordination between Israel and Egypt has tightened to help beat back an Islamist-led insurgency in the Sinai. The force's responsibilities include monitoring troop levels along the border and ensuring the freedom of navigation through the Strait of Tiran. The MFO was installed to monitor the demilitarization of the Sinai under a 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace accord. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this story.", "output": "left"}

How long will it take? Here's what to know about Georgia's recount of presidential votes With only about 14,000 votes separating President-elect Joe Biden and President Donald Trump in battleground Georgia, the state is heading into a recount of presidential votes. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said Wednesday that the state will recount presidential election results in each county by hand because of the close margin. On Wednesday, Biden was up by less than 0.3% of the nearly 5 million votes cast in Georgia. On Saturday, he was declared winner of the presidential election as some states continued to count votes, largely because his margins in several states are too wide for Trump to overcome. Georgia's presidential race has not yet been called because of the close result, but Biden appears poised to take the state's 16 electoral votes. Georgia's changing political makeup: From Southern lore to diverse community Here's what you need to know about Georgia's recount: Why is this happening? Georgia law requires an auditing process before the state certifies results. A \"risk-limiting audit\" includes the checking of a random sample of ballots by hand to compare against machine tabulation, to ensure accurate results. Raffensperger said Wednesday that he would choose to audit the presidential race. But because the margin between Biden and Trump is so slim, a random sample of ballots would not be a sufficient measure and a full hand recount is triggered. Raffensperger said the hand recount \"is really what makes the most sense with the national significance of this race and the closeness of this race.\" The decision to audit the presidential race is not because of the Trump campaign's request to do a hand recount, he said. \"This will help build confidence,\" Raffensperger said. A recount is provided for in Georgia law, but it not required, if the trailing candidate comes within a 0.5% margin of the leading candidate. Biden leads by less than 0.3%. Raffensperger is also under fire from the Republican incumbent senators from his state, Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who alleged without evidence that there was misconduct in the administration of the election. Although the senators called for him to resign, \"that is not going to happen. The voters of Georgia hired me, and the voters will be the one to fire me,\" Raffensperger said in a statement. How does a hand recount work? In a hand recount, instead of scanners reading and tallying the vote on each ballot, scanners will be used only to count ballots. Election workers will hand sort ballots into piles for each candidate, and the machines will count those piles. \"It will be a heavy lift. We will work with the counties to get this done in time for our state certification,\" Raffensperger said. How long will it take? The recount is expected to be completed with election results certified by the deadline of Nov. 20, Raffensperger said. The state is responsible for paying for the recount. He noted that election workers \"will be working plenty of overtime\" to get the recount done on time. Is Georgia recounting all 5 million ballots? Yes. While a risk-limiting audit would be done on a sample of votes, the hand recount will include each \"legally cast ballot,\" Raffensperger said. A sample of ballots would not be a reliable way to audit the results, he said, because of how tight the race is. \"When you have 5 million votes and the margin is so close, 14,000, if we pulled out 10,000 votes, all of a sudden it could say, well this is the person that won. We pull out 100,000 and this is the person that won. If we pull out a million, this person won,\" Raffensperger said. \"And that's why mathematically you have to do a full, hand-by-hand recount of all because the margin is so close.\" What happens after the recount? Because the hand recount is triggered by the audit, some have wondered whether the losing candidate can still request another recount after the certification of results . Responding to whether the Trump campaign could ask for another recount if Trump is still trailing, Raffensperger said he believes that the Trump campaign could request it if the margin was still within 0.5%. Another recount would be scanned rather than counted by hand, Raffensperger said. Biden has already earned the required 270 electoral votes to win the presidency, which will not change with any outcome of Georgia's recount. If his lead holds, Biden would gain an additional 16 electoral votes. Contributing: The Associated Press", "output": "left"}

Biden leads Trump in the state by about 20,000 votes—0.7 percent of 3.2 million ballots cast—according to the New York Times. Under Wisconsin law, a campaign must be within 1 percent to request a recount, which will cost Trump roughly $3 million should the current margin hold. The cost is refunded if the recount changes the election's outcome. Trump earned a surprise narrow victory in the state in 2016, defeating failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by about 23,000 votes. Green Party nominee Jill Stein successfully pushed for a recount, which cost $1.8 million. Trump's win was reaffirmed. In his statement, Stepien also criticized the \"ridiculous public polling\" in Wisconsin, where Biden was projected to defeat Trump by 6.7 points, according to the Real Clear Politics average. He cited \"reports of irregularities\" in the state's vote tabulation that could call the result into question. \"Despite ridiculous public polling used as a voter suppression tactic, Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be,\" Stepien said. \"There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results.\" The campaign has also filed suit to stop vote-counting in Michigan where Republicans have been denied \"meaningful access to numerous counting locations.\" Trump, who pulled off an upset victory in the state in 2016, trails Biden by fewer than 50,000 votes. \"President Trump’s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law,\" Stepien said in a release. \"We also demand to review those ballots which were opened and counted while we did not have meaningful access.

The president, speaking from the East Room of the White House, alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence, thanked his supporters and touted “record” turnout. “I want to thank the American people for their tremendous support. Millions and millions of people voted for us tonight and a very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people and we will not stand for it,” Trump said. “We won't stand for it.” Jen O’Malley Dillon, Joe Biden's campaign manager, said in a statement that Trump \"does not decide the outcome of this election. Joe Biden does not decide the outcome of this election. The American people decide the outcome of this election. And the democratic process must and will continue until its conclusion.\" The president was able to declare victory late Tuesday in battleground states of Florida, Ohio, and Iowa, and was able to clinch a big electoral win in traditionally red Texas, among other states, Fox News projected. But, a number of key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina, were too close to call. “We won states we weren’t expecting to win,” Trump said. “Florida, we didn’t win it, we won it by a lot.” “We won the great state of Ohio, we won Texas…It is also clear that we have won Georgia,” Trump said, despite that race not yet being called. “They’re never gonna catch us. They can’t catch us.” The president said the same of North Carolina, saying he has “clearly won,” and again, that “they can’t catch us,” despite that race, too, not yet being called. The president, and his campaign throughout the night, complained about the race in Arizona, which Fox News called for his rival, Democrat Joe Biden. The campaign, and the governor of Arizona, argued that some Election Day votes still needed to be counted. “Arizona, we have a lot of life in that,” Trump said. “Somebody declared victory, and maybe it will be, but certainly there were a lot of votes out there that we could get. We’re now just getting into Trump territory and that could be overturned.” The president shifted to Pennsylvania, and said he was “winning” in the state “by a tremendous amount of votes,” despite votes still being counted there. “All of a sudden, I said, what happened to the election? It’s off,” Trump said. “You know what happened. They knew they couldn’t win, so they said, let’s go to court.” Trump added that he predicted a legal battle, and said he has “been saying this since the day I heard there would be tens of millions of ballots sent,” referring to the unprecedented scale of mail-in voting amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment on our country,” Trump said, referring to the votes not being called in key states. “We were getting ready to win the election, frankly, we did win this election,” Trump said, adding that he wanted to “ensure the integrity” of the vote, and ensure the law is “used in a proper manner.” “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,” Trump said. “We want all voting to stop. We don’t want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list.” He added: “It’s a very sad moment. To me, this is a very sad moment, and we will win this.” “As far as I’m concerned, we already have won it,” Trump said. Biden, speaking earlier in Wilmington, Del., said just after midnight that he was “on track to win this election.” “Be patient,” Biden told supporters. “It ain’t over until every vote is counted—every ballot is counted.” He added: “But we’re feeling good, we’re feeling good about where we are.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden thanked supporters for their “patience,” and urged them to “keep the faith, guys.” “We’re gonna win this,” Biden said.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Election Night Viewer's Guide: Why You May Need To Be Patient Updated at 12:40 p.m. ET You're probably anxious about the results, but patience may truly be a virtue on election night. Followers of NPR's elections coverage should have read or heard this at least a few times by now: We may not know who wins the presidential election (or any number of other down-ballot races) on Tuesday night or early Wednesday, and that's OK. State results are not final on election night; instead, organizations like The Associated Press — which NPR relies on for race calls — determine most winners well before local officials tabulate all votes. But this year we're expecting slower counts, and the reason is straightforward: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, many states modified their voting rules, broadening access to mail-in voting and accelerating what had already been a rising mail-in voting trend. And mailed-in ballots — with envelopes to open and signatures to check — simply take longer to tabulate than in-person votes. Some individual state rules play key roles too. Take two swing-state examples: Florida allows counties to process ballots well ahead of Election Day, while officials in Pennsylvania have to wait until the morning of Election Day to begin that work. And with far more voters opting for mail-in or drop-off ballots this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has conceded: \"We probably won't know results on election night.\" Similar restrictive rules on ballot processing are in place in Wisconsin and Michigan as well. And, of course, these states may play a crucial role in deciding who wins the presidency. In fact, likely slow-counting Pennsylvania is considered by forecasters the most likely state to put Democratic nominee Joe Biden or President Trump over the election-capturing 270-electoral-vote threshold. Now add in another element: Poll after poll has shown that Democratic voters said they were far more likely than Republicans this election to use mail-in ballots. GOP voters' preference for in-person voting is likely due at least in part to Trump's unfounded claims of widespread fraud associated with mail-in ballots. And remember those different state rules about counting mail ballots. A clear partisan divide over voting method means that states that release their mail-in votes first will likely appear favorable — at least initially — for the Democrat Biden, and states that count in-person ballots first will likely appear better for Trump. This may not be a small shift, either. An analysis by FiveThirtyEight estimates that Pennsylvania could see a 21-point shift in the overall margin, from 3 a.m. ET Wednesday to the final result. Understanding these potentially misleading shifts may give you a better grasp on election night, as it unfolds. With that out of the way, let's look hour by hour: Final Polls That Close At 7 p.m. ET - Georgia (16 electoral votes) - Indiana (11) - Kentucky (8) - South Carolina (9) - Vermont (3) - Virginia (13) Top states/races to watch: Georgia highlights the first batch of states. It's a presidential toss-up, and it has not one but two contested U.S. Senate races. Georgia has already begun processing its mail-in ballots, which should expedite results and give us an early glimpse about the course of the evening. But — now talk about patience — both Senate contests could go to January runoffs if no candidate gets a majority of a race's vote. The Senate balance of power could indeed be decided in 2021. Also keep an eye on South Carolina, where Republican incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham is in a tight contest with Democrat and record-fundraiser Jaime Harrison. Toss-up House seats: - Open Indiana 5th District - Open Virginia 5th District Final Polls That Close At 7:30 p.m. ET - North Carolina (15) - Ohio (18) - West Virginia (5) Top states/races to watch: Hello, North Carolina. The state will likely have tight races for president, U.S. Senate and governor. Democrats hold narrow leads in the polling averages for all three contests, giving the party one of its prime opportunities to flip a Senate seat — in addition to potentially giving Biden a big boost. The state is also likely to count relatively quickly with most results — advance votes — expected shortly after polls close on election night. Ohio is a presidential toss-up state as well, but it's thought to be a safer bet than some others to stay in Trump's column. Toss-up House seat: Ohio 1st District, with Republican incumbent Steve Chabot Final Polls That Close At 8 p.m. ET - Alabama (9) - Connecticut (7) - District of Columbia (3) - Delaware (3) - Florida (29) - Illinois (20) - Massachusetts (11) - Maryland (10) - Maine (4) - Missouri (10) - Mississippi (6) - New Hampshire (4) - New Jersey (14) - Oklahoma (7) - Pennsylvania (20) - Rhode Island (4) - Tennessee (11) Top states/races to watch: Now we're really into the heart of the night. Pennsylvania, as we detailed above, is key for the presidential race but likely slow to count. So Florida will be the most important state here. Most of the state's polls actually close at 7 p.m. ET, and all early votes and mail ballots tabulated in advance are supposed to be released starting around 7:30 p.m. But remember, those advance votes might not be where the race ultimately ends up. Maine is also notable for two reasons. One, it doles out two of its four electoral votes by congressional district, and the northern 2nd district is competitive. And two, the state has a toss-up Senate race, as Republican Sen. Susan Collins faces a tough reelection challenge. Ranked-choice voting could determine the winner. Alabama's Senate seat is also one to watch, as Republicans are expected to oust Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in the conservative state. Toss-up House seats: - Illinois 13th District, with Republican incumbent Rodney Davis - Missouri 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Ann Wagner - New Jersey 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Jeff Van Drew - Oklahoma 5th District, with Democratic incumbent Kendra Horn - Pennsylvania 10th District, with Republican incumbent Scott Perry Final Polls That Close At 8:30 p.m. ET - Arkansas (6) Toss-up House seat: 2nd District, with Republican incumbent French Hill Final Polls That Close At 9 p.m. ET - Arizona (11) - Colorado (9) - Kansas (6) - Louisiana (8) - Michigan (16) - Minnesota (10) - North Dakota (3) - Nebraska (5) - New Mexico (5) - New York (29) - South Dakota (3) - Texas (38) - Wisconsin (10) - Wyoming (3) Top states/races to watch: Fourteen states — accounting for the majority of electoral votes — have final polls that close at 9 p.m. ET. Five of those states are considered competitive in the presidential race, along with Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. Texas, which saw record early voting, is the big presidential prize. The longtime Republican stronghold has been trending more purple, but a Biden win there would be a massive development. The state is expected to count relatively quickly too. Other presidential states to watch are Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Of note: In Arizona, mail votes can be processed and counted well ahead of time, so that should expedite many results; but in Michigan, lots of places could only begin processing absentee ballots the day before Election Day, while Wisconsin can't begin its processing work until Election Day itself. Another note on key Texas and Michigan: They're two of the states that stretch across two time zones, so while final polls close at 9 p.m. ET, most close at 8 p.m. ET. These 9 p.m. states also include several key Senate races, including an open seat in Kansas and competitive races in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan and Texas. Arizona and Colorado are considered two of Democrats' best pickup opportunities. Toss-up House seats: - Arizona 6th District, with Republican incumbent David Schweikert - Open Michigan 3rd District - Minnesota 1st District, with Republican incumbent Jim Hagedorn - Minnesota 7th District, with Democratic incumbent Collin Peterson - Nebraska 2nd District, with Republican incumbent Don Bacon - New Mexico 2nd District, with Democratic incumbent Xochitl Torres Small - Open New York 2nd District - New York 11th, with Democratic incumbent Max Rose - New York 22nd District, with Democratic incumbent Anthony Brindisi - New York 24th District, with Republican incumbent John Katko - Texas 10th District, with Republican incumbent Michael McCaul - Texas 21st District; with Republican incumbent Chip Roy - Open Texas 22nd District Final Polls That Close At 10 p.m. ET - Iowa (6) - Montana (3) - Nevada (6) - Utah (6) Top states/races to watch: Iowa is the main event here with toss-up races for president, U.S. Senate and two for the U.S. House. Trump won Iowa by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016, so a loss or even slim win there for him this year could portend a tough go across the northern swing states. Nevada is also a closely contested presidential state, while the marquee matchup in Montana is for U.S. Senate, as Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock tries to knock off GOP Sen. Steve Daines in the conservative state. The race to replace Bullock for governor is also considered a toss-up. Toss-up House seats: - Iowa 1st District, with Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer - Open Iowa 2nd District - Utah 4th District, with Democratic incumbent Ben McAdams Final Polls That Close At 11 p.m. / 12 a.m. / 1 a.m. ET 11 p.m. ET - California (55) - Idaho (4) - Oregon (7) - Washington (12) 12 a.m. ET Wednesday - Hawaii (4) 1 a.m. ET - Alaska (3) Toss-up House seats: - California 21st District, with Democratic incumbent T.J.

But that’s just what Glenn Greenwald has done, following in the martyred footsteps of erstwhile New York Times freethinker Bari Weiss. In a 4,000-word Substack post, Greenwald resigned from his healthy perch at The Intercept, a publication he co-founded, explaining, in his typically piqued and exhaustive manner, that he had been “censored.” The censorship—an inflated and, in this case, misapplied term that Greenwald would probably mock if used by someone else—concerns a column Greenwald submitted about Hunter Biden’s now infamous laptop. In Greenwald’s view, the column was censored in favor of a pro-Biden narrative being promulgated throughout The Intercept, a once noble publication now laid low by the plague of liberal-leftist illiberalism and groupthink that has become Greenwald’s recent obsession. As part of his comprehensive documentation of his Intercept exit, Greenwald posted the column on Substack, where he said his writing will appear for now. Greenwald also posted email exchanges with Intercept editors that indicate they thought the column, among other deficits, included sweeping and unsubstantiated claims about media malfeasance and implied Biden family corruption. As Intercept editor Peter Maas wrote, in a section that Greenwald bolded: “Overall I think this piece can work best if it is significantly narrowed down to what you first discussed with Betsy [Reed]—media criticism about liberal journalists not asking Biden the questions he should be asked more forcefully, and why they are failing to do that.” Censorship! Or, just maybe, an editorial note that a notoriously egotistical writer doesn’t like. That Greenwald chose to bold this section—as if it exemplified the suppressive behavior of what he calls “an increasingly authoritarian, fear-driven, repressive editorial team in New York bent on imposing their own ideological and partisan preferences on all writers”—only reveals his lack of familiarity with any rigorous editing. You could spend hours of your life that you’ll never get back parsing Greenwald’s resignation letter, his spiked column, the emails from editors, and his feverish tweets about it all. Instead, you could skip to the real problem here, which is that Greenwald seems to think he is beyond editing or critique. As he wrote to an editor, “Recall that under my contract, and the practice of The Intercept over the last seven years, none of my articles is edited unless it presents the possibility of legal liability or complex original reporting.” There’s no need to exalt editing as a rarefied practice to argue for its importance. A good editor is a useful collaborator who, among other things, corrects inaccuracies and saves a writer from his worst tendencies. Among Greenwald’s is an utter certitude in whatever he does, no matter the klaxons blaring, from colleagues and the evidence right in front of him, that perhaps he might be wrong. Humility and a tolerance of ambiguity have never been hallmarks of his work. In his resignation letter, Greenwald claims that he felt forced to leave The Intercept and didn’t have much of a plan beyond hoping that his supporters would follow him to Substack, where they can contribute directly to his work. But deeper in the letter, he reveals that he had been considering a post-Intercept future for some time: “I have spent a couple of months in active discussions with some of the most interesting, independent and vibrant journalists, writers and commentators across the political spectrum about the feasibility of securing financing for a new outlet that would be designed to combat these trends.” It would be a new publication, he said, staffed by people from across the political spectrum who, according to a document that they’ve been working on, share a belief that “American media is gripped in a polarized culture war that is forcing journalism to conform to tribal, groupthink narratives that are often divorced from the truth and cater to perspectives that are not reflective of the broader public but instead a minority of hyper-partisan elites.” An informed media observer, or someone who spends too much time on Twitter, could come up with a list of who might be called to join such a publication: Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Andrew Sullivan, Zaid Jilani, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Michael Tracey, perhaps some podcasters notorious for straddling the left-right divide, and anyone else who thinks that threats to speech emanate from a censorious, liberal-dominated culture and not from Donald Trump, corporate power, or police brutalizing protesters in the streets. Forget Persuasion or Quillette or whatever free speech absolutist publication is currently fermenting in a billionaire’s petri dish. This will be a Voltron of some of the most insufferable people in American media, few of whom do any original reporting anymore, decrying the cancellation of their friends at the hands of frigid elites. Funded by those same elites, it likely will be humorless and dull, hammering on the same tired culture war tropes until they are unrecognizable. And who will fund such a publication, whose staff will likely expect to recuperate the hefty salaries they are accustomed to? The billionaire that puts libertarian iconoclasts, professional rageaholics, racist disaffected conservatives, and some members of the so-called Intellectual Dark Web on the same payroll will be far more malevolent than Intercept owner Pierre Omidyar, who has no shortage of his own peculiar investments and unacknowledged political commitments. Some possibilities come to mind—perhaps a Trump-friendly tech mogul notorious for killing a genuinely free-thinking publication—but one hesitates to summon the demon by naming it. Beyond how grim it all looks, it’s rather sad. Greenwald has done groundbreaking reporting on NSA surveillance and Brazilian corruption. He’s risked jail to report necessary truths. He’s correct that much of the media is, in one form or another, corrupt—occupying a narrow Overton window, funded by special interests, willing to launder the reputations of awful people like Greenwald’s bête noire David Frum, the former George W. Bush speechwriter who is comfortably ensconced at The Atlantic. Cable news is irredeemable. A great deal of digital media is sponsored content, ad fraud, and content farms propping up more prestigious investigative units or simply pumping money into the pockets of venal corporate owners. Individual journalists, when they aren’t forced to seek an exit from an industry in terminal decline, are left to chase readers and clout on Twitter. There’s plenty to mock, as Greenwald spends hours doing each day. Whether his ornery brand of media criticism—often divorced from the material and labor conditions afflicting the profession—is the best use of his time and influence is apparently not up for question. Betsy Reed, The Intercept’s editor in chief, summed up the situation well, writing in a response to Greenwald’s resignation: “We have the greatest respect for the journalist Glenn Greenwald used to be, and we remain proud of much of the work we did with him over the past six years. It is Glenn who has strayed from his original journalistic roots, not The Intercept.” Bombast and ego have always been at the heart of Greenwald’s writing. But like many star journalists left to marinate in their own juices for too long, he’s become an asshole who equates being edited with the targeted suppression of his righteous beliefs. Whatever he does next will be interesting, at least at first, but absent a Snowden-level leak entrusted to him, his work is unlikely to be essential. That’s not all for the worse. With excellent reporting on militarism, political corruption, environmental issues, and much else, The Intercept has matured into an important publication producing exactly the kind of broadly adversarial journalism Greenwald has always sought. Its many fine journalists will be better off when they are out of the founder’s long shadow. Greenwald himself may not be.", "output": "left"}

Bobulinski didn’t want this interview. He doesn’t need to do it, but his reputation was being smeared as Russian misinformation. He was a guest at the final debate and when the former vice president denied being involved in Hunter’s business dealings, he almost stood up and shouted, “liar.” He added that Joe Biden is the “big guy” referenced in an equity arrangement with a shady Chinese firm with ties to the government. The “chairman” is also what Hunter called his dad during these negotiations. It’s in the texts Bobulinski turned over to the FBI from his other business partners, Rob Walker and James Gilliar. Bobulinski turned over all devices and business records relating to these Biden dealings and was interviewed by the FBI. He re-confirmed what we already knew in the wake of the exposure of Hunter Biden. In the end, while Bobulinski was picked as the point person for the Biden's business interests in China, the Chinese were only concerned about keeping the Bidens involved. He also feels that the Bidens are compromised and that money from this Chinese deal was really a private loan. He added that coming forward has led to death threats, with his former business associates warning that if he shot his mouth off, the reputations of all involved will be ruined.

The last president to nominate three new justices to the Supreme Court was Ronald Reagan. “Justice Barrett made clear she will issue rulings based solely upon a faithful reading of the law and the Constitution as written not legislate from the bench,” Trump said during a swearing in ceremony at the White House on Monday. \"“The American people put their trust in you and their faith in you as you take up the task of defending our laws, our Constitution and this country we all love.\" Monday's vote marked the end of a confirmation process that lasted less than 40 days from when late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died to when her successor, Barrett, was confirmed. During that time Democrats objected loudly to the speed and timing of the confirmation just before an election. Meanwhile, Republicans have touted Barrett's record as an academic and a judge as impeccable -- and her \"Well Qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association (ABA) whose representatives relayed descriptions of her as \"brilliant\" and an \"intellectual giant.\" Justice Clarence Thomas administered the Constitutional Oath to Barrett at the White House on Monday night, while Chief Justice will administer the Judicial Oath to her in a private ceremony at the Court on Tuesday. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, was the only Republican to vote against Barrett after expressing objections to moving a Supreme Court nomination before an election after Republicans blocked Obama nominee Merrick Garland ahead of the 2016 election. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has also expressed the same concerns as Collins and voted against a procedural motion to advance Barrett's nomination on Sunday, but she voted for the nominee Monday after saying she would not hold her process objections against Barrett. All 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats voted against Barrett's confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on Sunday, as the Senate advanced a procedural motion that set up the Monday vote, that his party should \"feel good about\" their involvement in moving Barrett's confirmation forward. \"This is something to really be proud of and feel good about. We made an important contribution to the future of this country,\" McConnell said as the Senate advanced Barrett for confirmation for a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. \"A lot of what we've done over the last four years will be undone sooner or later by the next election ... They won't be able to do much about this for a long time to come.\" McConnell has made a point to prioritize judicial nominations during the nearly four years Trump has been the president. Barrett will be the 220th federal judge appointed by Trump to this point in his first term, trailing only Jimmy Carter all-time. McConnell's dogged focus on judicial appointments led to there being zero remaining vacancies on federal courts of appeals -- although Barrett's confirmation Monday creates another for him to fill. CLARENCE THOMAS TO ADMINISTER OATH OF OFFICE FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT Monday's vote followed 30 consecutive hours of floor debate -- running overnight Sunday into Monday -- after Republicans invoked cloture on the Barrett nomination in a rare Sunday session. The Barrett confirmation fight was not nearly as chaotic as the previous fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, which involved lurid accusations of sexual assault against the nominee and multiple rounds of hearings. In fact, Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called the Barrett hearings \"one of the best Senate hearings that I've participated in.\" She added to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: \"I want to thank you for your fairness and the opportunity of going back and forth.\" Graham responded: \"I know we have very different views about the judge and whether we should be doing this or not. But having said all that, to my Democratic colleagues, you have challenged the judge, you have challenged us, and I accept those challenges as being sincere and not personal.\" The collegiality between the longtime senators does not mean the nomination wasn't hard-fought, however. Interest groups on both sides poured tens of millions of dollars into advertising and Senate Democrats pulled out every conceivable procedural stop to pressure Republicans. That included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., forcing several procedural votes on topics from health care to coronavirus relief to shutting down the Senate. In one stunt that was particularly effective at squeezing the GOP, Schumer forced a vote on a measure that would ban the Justice Department from arguing against the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as it currently plans to when a case against it comes before the Supreme Court on Nov. 10. The \"cloture\" motion on that failed 51-43 -- it needed 60 votes to pass -- but succeeded in getting six moderate or electorally vulnerable Republican senators to back it. Beyond that, Senate Democrats even boycotted the beginning of the first markup on Barrett's nomination on Oct. 15 and the entirety of the second on Oct. 21, forcing the GOP to forge ahead by waiving committee rules that require at least two members of the minority party to be present for the committee to do business. Shortly before the vote to confirm Barrett, Schumer blasted the process as \"a decades-long effort to tilt the courts towards the right.\" \"This nomination is part of a decades-long effort to tilt the courts towards the right to accomplish through the courts what Republicans could never accomplish through Congress,\" he tweeted. But despite the pressure tactics from Democrats, Republicans stuck together and had the votes to confirm Barrett. For many of the GOP senators, Barrett's qualifications were inescapable and were the most important factors in their votes.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Pope Francis came out in support of civil union laws for same-sex couples, according to a new documentary that premiered Wednesday in Rome. “Homosexuals have a right to be a part of the family,” Francis said in “Francesco,” a new film about his life and papacy, according to Catholic News Agency. “They’re children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out, or be made miserable because of it.” “What we have to create is a civil union law,” the pope continued. “That way they are legally covered. I stood up for that.” “Francesco,” according to its website, is “a film that shows us the world as it is today and a path to understanding a better future for tomorrow, through the remarkable work of Pope Francis. It is a search for hope, humanity, compassion, unity, and redemption inside the darkness of our times.” Its trailer highlights some of the pope’s comments on the coronavirus pandemic, the environment, and clerical sex abuse, as well as his oblique condemnation of President Donald Trump’s border wall as “not Christian.” Francis has raised eyebrows before for making comments many believed departed from millennia-old teachings of the Catholic Church regarding homosexuality, though Pope Francis was merely outlining dogma in a more public way than his predecessors. A few months into his pontificate in 2013, Francis noted that the Church makes a distinction between homosexual acts, which he maintained are sinful, and homosexual orientation, which he said is not. Regarding the rumored “gay lobby” in the Vatican, Francis responded, “If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge?” “The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well,” Francis continued. “It says they should not be marginalized because of this but that they must be integrated into society.” He also condemned lobbying by the gay community or any community. “The problem is not having this orientation. We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem.” Francis has nevertheless remained adamant that practicing gay men should not be priests. As The Daily Wire reported: After months of seemingly avoiding the issue following the Pennsylvania grand jury report that alleged 300 predator priests molested (mostly male) victims over a 75-year period while church hierarchy covered it up, Pope Francis has given perhaps the harshest denunciation of his pontificate regarding homosexuality in the priesthood. According to the New York Post, Pope Francis “unequivocally” stated over the weekend that “homosexual men should not be admitted into the Catholic clergy and gay priests should practice celibacy or leave the church.” “There’s no room for that kind of affection,” Pope Francis said regarding same-sex attracted men in the priesthood. Pope Francis made his remarks during an interview with Spanish priest Fernando Prado in which he referred to homosexuality in the priesthood as a “serious issue.” “The issue of homosexuality is a very serious issue that must be adequately discerned from the beginning with the candidates,” Pope Francis said, according to The Guardian. “In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church.” He continued: “This is something I am concerned about, because perhaps at one time it did not receive much attention.” Related: Pope Francis Talks Tough On Gay Priests: ‘No Room For That’", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The Supreme Court said Monday that it will hear a challenge to the Trump administration's use of Pentagon money to build the southern border wall and also its appeal of a ruling that blocked a policy sending asylum applicants to Mexico while they wait for their appeals to be heard. A federal appeals court ruled in June that the government improperly diverted $2.5 billion of Pentagon counterdrug program money to build more than 100 miles of border wall. The court said only Congress could approve such a transfer. President Donald Trump ordered the use of the department money last year after a fight over his budget led to a partial government shutdown. It ended after Democrats approved money for border wall construction, but nowhere near what the president wanted. The wall's opponents, including the Sierra Club and some border communities, said the president cannot spend more than Congress has authorized or use the money in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of appropriations already made. Their lawsuit also said an emergency declaration law invoked by the president allows use of Pentagon construction funds only to support the military. \"There is no emergency requiring the use of the armed forces along the U.S.-Mexico border, and construction of a border wall is not necessary to support such use of the armed forces,\" the suit said. A separate law passed by Congress allows the use of Defense Department support only for building facilities needed to block drug smuggling at the border, they said. The Sierra Club said the wall would also cause irreversible environmental damage. \"Endangered species could disappear from our southern border, while fragile landscapes are decimated by this destructive and pointless vanity project,\" Gloria Smith, the group's managing attorney, said. In defending the plan, the Department of Justice said federal law gives the president wide latitude in deciding when to declare a national emergency. \"The statutory scheme leaves to the president the determination of whether a national emergency requires the use of the armed forces,\" the department said, adding that federal law allows use of the money for unforeseen military requirements. The government also said that the groups filing the lawsuit had no legal standing to challenge the wall program. The Supreme Court will hear the case early next year, with a decision by the spring. But if Joe Biden wins the election, the federal government would probably stop construction anyway. 'Remain in Mexico' policy Also Monday, the court agreed to hear the administration's appeal of a lower court ruling on its \"remain in Mexico\" policy of returning asylum-seekers to that country while awaiting court hearings. In response to a surge of immigrants at the southern border from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Trump administration began sending people seeking asylum back across the border to Mexico instead of allowing them to wait in the U.S. for their cases to be heard. From late January 2019 until the program was suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 60,000 people were shuttled back to Mexico under what the government called the Migrant Protection Protocols. An immigrant rights group challenged the policy in court, arguing that it put the lives of thousands of people at risk by sending them to highly dangerous conditions in Mexico, where gun battles, murders, kidnappings and sexual assaults were common. Their lawsuit said the program violated a treaty requiring the U.S. to guarantee that it would not \"expel or return\" noncitizens to any place where they faced the likelihood of persecution. Lower federal courts agreed and ordered the government to stop enforcing the program, but the Supreme Court in March put that on hold and allowed the government to resume the policy while it appealed those rulings. In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, the Trump administration said people attempting to enter the country illegally actually seek asylum only about half the time, and only about 9 percent of applications are granted. Sending them to Mexico to wait for a decision, the Department of Homeland Security said, reduced one of the key incentives for illegal immigration — the ability to stay in the U.S. during immigration proceedings In many cases, the government said, people without a valid asylum claim simply skip their hearing dates and disappear into the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security largely discontinued the program in March after an order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention barred entry at the border of anyone lacking legal authority for admission. The case also will be heard early next year, with a decision by the spring.", "output": "left"}

Trump spoke about experimental UV light technologies. Biden keeps repeating the same false claim. The former vice president told an ABC News town hall on Thursday evening that the president told people to put “bleach in your arm” and therefore should not be trusted to pronounce whether a potential coronavirus vaccine was safe or not. As Breitbart News has noted in previous fact checks: Trump never told anyone to inject bleach, much less in their arm. Nor did he tell anyone to injest bleach — another common Democratic Party talking point. On Thursday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) claimed — falsely — that Trump told people to “swallow Clorox.” As Breitbart News has noted, and as the transcripts of White House press briefings confirm, Trump was discussing the future use of experimental ultraviolet light technology to disinfect surfaces and remove the coronavirus. The UV technology is already being used to disinfect offices and other spaces. Trump wondered openly whether it might be possible to “inject” UV light into the body — a technology that is currently in development, and which was reported in the media just days before. When he was asked a follow-up question about whether he thought disinfectant should be “injected into a person,” Trump said no: “It wouldn’t be through injection. We’re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.” Biden said that he would take a vaccine if it were approved by scientists. The scientists leading the administration’s Operation Warp Speed have said that they would not approve any vaccine if it were not safe for people to take. Joel B.

The President would love nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would, in fact, pack the court or not pack the court.” Last week, Biden told reporters he would not address the issue until after the November 3 election, but his comments Monday go further than when he has demurred in his recent answers on the issue following the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by Ginsburg. With the Republican-controlled Senate likely to confirm President Donald Trump’s third Supreme Court justice, creating a solid 6-3 conservative majority, some progressive members of the Democratic Party have floated the idea of expanding the size of the high court – and adding liberal justices – should Biden win and Republicans lose control of the Senate. Some of those in the progressive wing of the party see adding seats to the court as the only way to protect landmark decisions like the one made in Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion in the US. Biden, a former longtime senator, is an institutionalist who has centered his campaign on a return to normalcy and civility. Polls show he is winning over moderates, and he is hesitant to give Trump any new ammunition to link him to his party’s progressive wing. As the so-called court-packing concept has increasingly entered the fray in recent weeks, both Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, have refused to answer questions about their positions on it, including during their respective debates with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. During the primary, Biden was consistent in his opposition to court-packing. He said during a Democratic presidential debate last October that he “would not get into court-packing,” adding, “We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.” He reiterated his position and this rationale when a voter asked him about his position on expanding the court during a town hall in Iowa later in December. He also told the Iowa Starting Line earlier this year that he opposed court-packing because Democrats will “live to rue the day.” For her part, Harris would not answer questions from Pence when he pressed her on the issue during their debate last week, with the vice president saying, “You gave a non-answer. Joe Biden gave a non-answer.” “The American people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is, they are going to pack the Supreme Court,” Pence claimed at the debate.

Refresh this page for updates.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that began at 9 a.m. and ended after 8 p.m., the former Notre Dame law professor, repeatedly fought back against suggestions that her nomination to the high court came with a promise to rule with conservatives when it came to abortion or an upcoming case that could dismantle the Affordable Care Act, leaving millions without healthcare coverage. “I have made no commitment to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House, about how I would decide any case,” she told the committee. Time and again, Barrett tried to assure senators she has no agenda and would view a case on its merits and the law. Despite efforts by Democrats to paint her as a hard-right conservative, Barrett refused to be pinned down on such hot-button issues as LGBTQ rights and issues surrounding ballots cast in the presidential election which Trump has portrayed as corrupt, fraudulent and subject to legal challenge. When the subject of racial justice came up, she recounted how she wept with one of her daughters, who is Black and adopted from Haiti, over the death of George Floyd while being pinned down by police in Minneapolis.

And that you use your two children as props,\" Kennedy said. \"Do you use your children as props?\" Barrett paused before telling Kennedy she and her husband weighed the personal costs of her nomination and the hurtful comments that would target not only her, but her family. \"My husband and I had to really weigh the costs of this,\" she said, adding that remarks like those are \"deeply offensive and hurtful things that are not only hurtful to me, but are hurtful to my children, who are my children, who we love, and who we brought home and made part of our family.\" She added: \"Accusations like that are cruel.\" Barrett's seven children, who were in the room for most of the day, were not seated behind her when Kennedy asked the question Tuesday evening. \"I didn't want to ask that question when your kids were here,\" he told Barrett. – Christal Hayes Kamala Harris highlights 'devastating impact' Barrett could have on healthcare Sen. Kamala Harris used her prime-time slot questioning Barrett to \"talk directly with the American people,\" highlighting the important impacts Barrett's confirmation could have on a woman's right to an abortion and healthcare for millions of Americans. The Democratic nominee for vice president, who took a break from the campaign trial to question Barrett virtually from her Washington, D.C. office, noted the pending case concerning the future of the Affordable Care Act that is set to come before the Supreme Court days after the Nov. 3 Election Day. \"This is not a hypothetical. This is happening,\" said Harris, D-Calif. \"People are scared. People are scared of what will happen if the Affordable Care Act is destroyed in the middle of a pandemic.\" Like other senators on Tuesday, Harris spent much of the time she was allotted to question Barrett by offering a campaign-style speech where she both stressed the real-life impacts this nomination could have on healthcare and pressed Barrett on calls for her to recuse from the case set to come before the high court on Nov. 10. Harris pressed for Barrett to \"consider\" the \"devastating impact\" it would have on millions should the law be gutted. She then highlighted how this nomination could be the tipping point that allows the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court case that protects a woman's right to choose an abortion. \"The threat to choice is real,\" Harris said. \"I would suggest that we not pretend that we don't know how this nominee views a woman's right to choose.\" Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, is known for her questioning of witnesses and gained the national spotlight during the 2018 Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her when they were both teenagers – allegations he has denied strenuously. Trump told a rally in Pennsylvania that he watched the exchange on television as he flew into the Keystone State. The president “compared” Harris to “Amy,” who he described as a “great future Supreme Court justice.” “Amy’s made a great impression,” Trump told the crowd in Johnstown, Pa. – Christal Hayes, John Fritze and David Jackson Trump weighs in on hearing, bashes Sen. Cory Booker President Donald Trump weighed in during Barrett’s confirmation hearing to bash Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., accusing him of making “false charges and statements about me.” Booker had mentioned several recent controversies involving Trump, including his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and support for lawsuits seeking to overturn Obamacare. At one point Booker told Barrett, \"can you understand the fear of giving a president that has said that they will put someone there that will tear down the Affordable Care Act as taking away health care for millions of Americans?” Barrett sidestepped questions about the Affordable Care Act and other hot-button issues throughout the hearing, telling senators she would not opine on issues that could come before the Court. Addressing recent controversy involving Trump’s dodge of a question during the first presidential debate about condemning white supremacists, Booker asked Barrett if she condemned white supremacy, to which the judge replied “yes.” \"Thank you. I'm glad to see that you said that,\" Booker said. \"I wish our president would say that so resolutely and unequivocally as well.\" The New Jersey Democrat also pressed Barrett on whether presidents should commit to a peaceful transfer of power, another Trump-related controversy, but she declined to answer the question, citing current “political controversy” she wanted to stay out of as a judge. – Nicholas Wu Sexual preference’: Barrett apologizes after facing criticism for language regarding LGBTQ rights Barrett faced criticism Tuesday regarding language she used when discussing LGBTQ rights. She was asked whether she agrees with Judge Antonin Scalia’s criticism of the same-sex marriage ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges – the landmark case which legalized gay marriage in the United States and which advocates worry that Barrett would not support if she were confirmed to the nation's highest court. Barrett's answer? “I have never discriminated on the basis of sexual preference and would never discriminate on the basis of sexual preference.” That response drew considerable blow-back on social media from LGBTQ advocates who “sexual preference” implies that sexuality is a choice. The more precise, and accepted, term is “sexual orientation.” Pete Buttigieg, the former Democratic presidential candidate and openly gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, seemingly jabbed at Barrett’s wording, tweeting, “My *preference* is that the winner of this presidential election should choose the next justice.” The National Women’s Law Center also weighed in, saying “It's not a 'preference,' Judge Barrett.” Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, later slammed Barrett for saying \"sexual preference,\" saying the judge used an \"offensive and outdated term.\" \"I don't think it was an accident\" she used the phrase, Hirono said, citing Scalia's dissent in Obergefell. The Hawaii Democrat said Barrett's use of the phrase and her views on judicial precedents were why \"many people in the LGBT community are so concerned\" Obergefell could be overturned. Barrett apologized after Hirono spoke, saying, \"I certainly didn't mean, and would never mean, to use a term that would cause any offense in the LGBTQ community. So if I did, I greatly apologize for that.\" – Savannah Behrmann, Nicholas Wu Sen. Thom Tillis appears at confirmation hearing maskless Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who tested positive for coronavirus 11 days ago, addressed the committee without a mask and submitted a letter from his physician for the record that cleared his return. The letter (https://www.tillis.senate.gov/services/files/D05F78A0-BD05-4C68-9AB3-815C40E42660) does not say he has tested negative for COVID-19, but states he has met CDC guidelines clearing him from his quarantine. A statement from Tillis additionally says he will “enroll in the antibody research study through Atrium Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health and volunteer to participate in UNC Chapel Hill’s immunology study and help however I can to end COVID.” \"I want to thank my doctors who provided guidance throughout my quarantine since testing positive for COVID-19. I feel very fortunate that I had a mild case with few symptoms, and I want to thank North Carolinians for their prayers and well-wishes,” the statement read. – Savannah Behrmann Barrett declines to answer question on abortion ad Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked Amy Coney Barrett about her views on abortion because of a 2006 letter she had signed running alongside an ad calling for “an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.” Barrett, who signed the ad while serving as a University of Notre Dame law professor, told Hawley she had signed the ad on her way out of church, and added that she signed it when she was still a private citizen, and \"now I'm a public official.\" As a public official, she said, it would not be “appropriate” to express an “affirmative view” on the issue. Hawley has said he would only back a Supreme Court nominee who said Roe v. Wade had been “wrongly decided,\" according to the Washington Post. Asked by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., about the 2006 ad and a 2013 ad sponsored by the Notre Dame University Faculty for Life, Barrett told him she did not disclose them because she did not remember the ads. She noted previous nominees had to send in additional materials as well, especially when going through so much past material. \"It's a lot to try to find and remember\" 30 years worth of materials, she said. – Nicholas Wu Amy Coney Barrett: Supreme Court nominee Amy Barrett signed anti-abortion letter accompanying ad calling to overturn Roe v. Wade Sen. Amy Klobuchar probes Barrett's past In one of the more substantial lines of questioning Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., grilled Amy Coney Barrett on her past remarks and rulings, suggesting that by \"following the tracks,\" one gets a clear depiction that she would be a key conservative on the high court. \"The American people have to understand that you would be the polar opposite of Justice Ginsburg,\" Klobuchar said after listing off some of Barrett's past remarks and opinions on a host of issues, including abortion, guns and healthcare. Barrett, President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, is facing questions from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the second day of her confirmation hearings. Klobuchar asked Barrett about \"super precedents\" – Supreme Court decisions that are so ingrained in American life that they can't be overturned. The Minnesota Democrat noted that Barrett has called some cases a super precedent but would not use the term to describe Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that allows a woman's right to an abortion. \"I'm answering a lot of questions about Roe, which I think indicates that Roe doesn't fall in that category,\" Barrett said, explaining \"that doesn't mean that Roe should be overruled, but descriptively it does mean that it's not a case that everyone has accepted and doesn't call for its overruling.\" Other experts have similarly refrained from calling the case a \"super precedent.\" Klobuchar also pressed Barrett on voting rights and whether it's against the law to intimidate people casting their ballot at the polls, a nod to remarks by President Donald Trump that his supporters should monitor polling locations. “I can’t characterize the facts on a hypothetical situation,” Barrett told Klobuchar. – Christal Hayes What counts as a 'super precedent'? Amy Barrett's law review articles show how Supreme Court rulings like Roe v. Wade could be challenged Senators briefly stop asking questions At one point, senators stopped asking questions of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett during her second day of confirmation hearings Tuesday. Maybe it’s a sign that members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have conceded the outcome that she will emerge from this week’s hearings with a partisan endorsement: Republicans will vote to move her confirmation forward to the full Senate while Democrats will vote against that. For nearly two hours, senators practically stopped probing Barrett about judicial philosophy and spent their 30-minute speaking slots making speeches and attacking the other side. Utah Republican Mike Lee spoke at length about abortion. Rhode Island Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse, without asking a single question, spoke about the “dark money’ scheme he said is infiltrating politics and court appointments. Texas Republican Ted Cruz talked about the Ten Commandments and the Second Amendment before asking Barrett about her piano skills. In between, Cruz asked Barrett about her proficiency in the French language (so-so) and why she adopted two children from Haiti (she and her then-fiancée Jesse wanted to adopt after meeting other couples who did). “It really has enriched our family immeasurably,” she told Cruz. He then asked her what advice she would give young girls: “I was thinking about what my dad told me before a spelling bee that whatever boys can do, girls can do better,” she said. “And since my sons are sitting behind me, I’ll say boys are great too.” – Ledyard King Sen. Whitehouse outlines 'dark money' schemes to put conservatives on the Supreme Court Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., reiterated concerns he had about the influence of special interest groups and “dark money,” or funds raised by organizations not required to disclose donors, leading up to Barrett’s nomination to the Court. “Something is not right around the court. And dark money has a lot to do with it. Special interests have a lot to do with it,\" he said, outlining “schemes” in which donors picked judges, funded influence campaigns to support the judges, and then funded campaigns to “tell the judges what to do.” \"The Republican party platform tells us to look at how they want judges to rule to reverse Roe, to reverse Obamacare cases, and to reverse Obergefell and take away gay marriage. That is their stated objective and plan,” he said. “Why not take them at their word?\" Whitehouse also brought up his concerns about outside interest groups when he spoke with Barrett on by phone last week. Republicans counter that Democrats have themselves taken advantage of “dark money” from outside groups like Demand Justice to oppose Barrett’s nomination. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who spoke after Whitehouse, called Democratic critiques of dark money \"deeply, deeply, hypocritical\" because Ds collect more funds from Super PACs. Whitehouse finished his speech without asking the judge a question, telling her, “this gives a chance for you and I to have an interesting discussion tomorrow.” -Nicholas Wu and Ledyard King Barrett says she 'wept' with daughter, 17, after George Floyd's death Amy Coney Barrett's voice started to crack as she discussed footage of a Minneapolis officer kneeling on George Floyd's neck and the impact it had on her family this summer. Barrett, who has seven children including two she adopted from Haiti, told Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that she sat down with her teenage daughter, who is Black, and cried. Durbin had asked Barrett if she had seen the video during her confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \"As you might imagine, given that I have two Black children, that was very, very personal for my family,\" Barrett said about the footage of Floyd's arrest. Barrett said when the video was publicized, her husband was camping with their sons and she was home with her 17-year-old daughter, who was born in Haiti. \"All of this was erupting. It was very difficult for her,\" Barrett said. \"We wept together in my room.\" She noted that her family has had continued discussions about racism and how she tried to explain it to her young children. \"I mean, my children, to this point in their lives, have had the benefit of growing up in a cocoon where they have not experienced hatred or violence,\" she said. Durbin then asked whether there is racism still in the U.S. and whether it is systemic in America. \"I think it is an entirely uncontroversial and obvious statement, given that we just discussed the George Floyd video, that racism persists in our country,\" Barrett said. She added that while racism still is a problem, she could not say whether it is systemic or how to fix it. \"Those things are policy questions. They are hotly contested policy questions,\" she said, noting that diagnosing the issue of racism was \"beyond what I am capable of doing as a judge.\" Floyd, a Black man, died after an officer knelt on his neck for nearly 9 minutes in May. The footage of his death sparked massive protests in cities across the U.S. and deeper discussions about racism in America. – Christal Hayes Senators wear masks during hearing Lawmakers mostly kept their masks on during Tuesday’s confirmation hearing of Judge Amy Coney Barrett – except when speaking. Amy Coney Barrett took her mask off for the hearing, though her family sitting behind her all kept their masks on. “You can relax a bit, judge, and take your mask off,” Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham told Barrett at the beginning of the hearing. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who returned to the committee for the first time since testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, wore a mask while seated. Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who also tested positive for COVID-19, wore a mask too. Lee took his mask off while taking notes, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, returning from quarantine after coming into close contact with Lee, took his mask off to take a drink and then kept it off. – Nicholas Wu Barrett is not using notes at hearing Amy Coney Barrett cited various judges, cases and laws as she discussed her career and how she would rule on the Supreme Court in the second day of her confirmation hearings Tuesday. And she did it all from memory. As Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, started to question Barrett, he asked her to hold up the notebook sitting in front of her, noting most senators had multiple books and notebooks to reference. \"Is there anything on it,\" Cornyn asked as she held up a blank white notepad. \"The letterhead that says United States Senate,\" Barrett replied. Cornyn told her, \"that's impressive.\" Other recent Supreme Court nominees, including Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, had notes during their hearings. Kavanaugh used a binder and multiple legal notepads throughout his vetting by the Senate Judiciary Committee and Gorsuch was photographed jotting down notes on a legal pad. – Christal Hayes Barrett says she would consult with other justices on recusal from any election dispute case Senate Judiciary Democrats have seized on comments that President Donald Trump wants a Supreme Court justice seated quickly in case there’s a dispute over ballots or other procedures from the Nov. 3 election. On the second day of confirmation hearings Tuesday, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy pressed Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett on whether she should recuse herself if a case arises that could decide the presidency since it would involve someone who just nominated her to the high court. “Let me be clear I've made no commitments to anyone, not in the Senate, not over at the White House about how I would decide, any case,” Barrett told Leahy. She declined to speak specifically about a recusal from any election case, saying she would follow court procedure and consult with the other members of the court before deciding whether to participate in the ruling. “So, I can't offer an opinion on recusal without short circuiting that entire process,” she said. Leahy said the president’s statements about needing a justice seated soon – as well as his frequent comments questioning the legitimacy of mail-in ballots – have compromised not only her but the entire court. “Whether you like it or not, the president’s placed both you and the Supreme Court in the worst of positions,” he told her. – Ledyard King Barrett says she has 'absolutely not' made promises on future rulings Amy Coney Barrett paused to make clear that she hadn't made any guarantees on how she would rule on cases that come before the Supreme Court, including to President Donald Trump before he nominated her. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, asked Barrett during the second day of her confirmation hearings T about the \"suspicion\" over whether she'd made any commitments on any issues, including how she might rule on the Affordable Care Act. \"I want to be very, very clear about this Sen. Grassley. The answer is no,\" she said. \"No one ever talked about any case with me. No one on the executive branch side of it.\" Before nominating Barrett to the high court, Trump told reporters he wanted to fill the vacancy with his pick in case there was an Election Day legal dispute. The admission led to calls by Democrats that Barrett should recuse from ruling on any case centering on Election Day results. – Christal Hayes Barrett says she wasn't asked about overturning ACA before nomination Democrats are seeking to make Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett’s confirmation hearing about the Affordable Care Act, but in her first day answering questions, she had a pretty simple answer. While she has criticized Chief Justice John Roberts’ 5-4 ruling in the original Obamacare case in 2012, the case coming before the high court next month involves a completely different issue, she said. In 2012, the court was asked to decide if the entire law was unconstitutional. This time, it’s about whether a tax penalty that Congress eliminated in 2017 can be severed from the law, or whether that would bring down the rest of the law. Asked if she would recuse herself from that case if she’s confirmed by the time the Supreme Court takes up the issue, she said it’s “a legal issue” that she would discuss with her colleagues, not “a question that I could answer in the abstract.” But was she asked before being nominated if she would overturn the ACA? “Absolutely not,” she said. “I was never asked, and if I had been, that would have been a short conversation.” – Richard Wolf Barrett tries to assure senators she would be an impartial justice Amy Coney Barrett came to the second day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearing with an agenda: to assure senators she has no agenda. Not on abortion. Not on guns (and her family does own one). Not on health care or anything else. While her mentor, former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, famously had opinions on everything and expressed them freely, “If I’m confirmed you would not be getting Justice Scalia, you would be getting Justice Barrett.” If confirmed and hearing controversial cases on the high court, Barrett said she would read the briefs, hear the arguments and consult with her clerks and colleagues before rendering a decision. “Judges can’t just wake up one day and say ‘I have an agenda’ … like a royal queen,” she said. Feinstein doesn't get answer on the Affordable Care Act Amy Coney Barrett largely sidestepped questions from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, on how she would rule on contentious issues that could come before the Supreme Court, like health care Asked about the consequences of overturning the Affordable Care Act, Barrett replied, “If there were policy differences or policy consequences, those are for this body. For the court, it’s really a question of the law and going where the law leads, and leaving the policy decisions up to you.” Towards the end of her question-and-answer session, Feinstein asked Barrett about the legality of President Donald Trump’s threat to delay the election, and Barrett again sidestepped the question. She said if she gave answers off-the-cuff to a question like that, \"I would be basically a legal pundit. And I don't think we want judges to be legal pundits.\" -Nicholas Wu and Richard Wolf Amy Coney Barrett: Amy Barrett's law review articles show how Supreme Court rulings like Roe v. Wade could be challenged Barrett sidesteps question about abortion It didn’t take long Tuesday for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to be questioned about abortion. And it didn’t take long for her to sidestep the question. As she did on other hot-button issues, Barrett explained it would be wrong for her to express her view on Roe v Wade or a later abortion case decided by the Supreme Court because a similar case could come before the high court. “It would actually be wrong and a violation of the canons for me to do that,” Barrett told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “It signals to litigants that I might tilt one way or another on a pending case.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the panel, called Barrett’s answer “distressing,” and Barrett acknowledged she understood why the question was asked. But the nominee told the panel, “I don’t have any agenda” to try to overrule Roe or its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, both of which were decided in the 20th century. What she promised to do is to “follow the rules of stare decisis,” or Supreme Court precedent. – Richard Wolf Barrett says ‘rule of law’, not her faith, would drive her judgment Barrett told the committee that while her faith “was important\" to her and her family, she would only apply the law to the cases that would come before her as a Supreme Court justice should she be confirmed. Barrett, whose devout Catholic faith has been the subject of criticism by opponents who say she’s too religiously conservative to serve on the nation’s highest court, said she realized that her private life would be under a microscope by accepting the nomination. “We knew that our lives would be combed over for any negative detail. We knew that our faith would be caricatured. We knew our family would be attacked,” she said as her husband Jesse, and seven children sat behind her. “And so we had to decide whether those difficulties would be worth it, because what sane person would go through that if there wasn't a benefit on the other side.?” She continued: “And the benefit I think is I'm committed to the rule of law and the role of the Supreme Court and dispensing equal justice for all.\" – Ledyard King Graham tries to turn Obamacare arguments against Democrats Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., started Tuesday’s hearing by launching an attack on Obamacare, the issue Democrats fixated on during Monday’s hearing as they laid out their primary reason why they oppose Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Democrats have concerns Barrett will be a – if not the – deciding vote next month on the Supreme Court in a case that could end the Affordable Care Act. “From my point of view Obamacare has been a disaster for the state of South Carolina,” said Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee holding the confirmation hearings. “We want something better. We want something different.” Graham complained that three states – California, New York and Massachusetts – have received a disproportionately high amount of health care assistance through the decade-old law, while smaller states like his have been shortchanged. Democratic senators Monday spent most of their time saying that if Barrett was confirmed, millions of Americans would lose not only their insurance through the health exchange and expanded Medicaid, but many more would also lose coverage through the law’s requirement that insurance firms cannot deny coverage to people based on a pre-existing medical condition. Graham said Tuesday he wants a health care plan that gives states like his more of a share of the federal money (like a “block grant”) that also includes the pre-existing condition mandate. – Ledyard King Day 2 of confirmation hearings begins The second day of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings began shortly after 9 a.m. Barrett, President Donald Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, sat alone at a table in the hearing room with her husband and children sitting nearby. – Sean Rossman Barrett's opening statement: Read Trump Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett's opening statement Sen. Thom Tillis, who tested positive for COVID, appears in-person at Tuesday's hearing Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who announced a positive COVID-19 result on Oct. 2, attended in-person Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett after receiving a letter from his doctor clearing him to participate. He wore a mask during the hearing. “I feel very fortunate that I had a mild case with few symptoms, and I want to thank North Carolinians for their prayers and well-wishes,” Tillis said in a statement, adding that he would take part in antibody studies to promote research on the virus. His office released a letter dated Oct. 12 from his personal physician Dr. Jack Faircloth telling Tillis he would fulfill the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for ending quarantine of “at 4 pm today.” The CDC says people who tested positive for COVID-19 are cleared to interact with others after quarantining for at least 10 days after the onset of symptoms, remaining fever-free for at least a day, and remaining free of other symptoms. It is unclear if Tillis tested negative for COVID-19. He is one of two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee who tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this month. The other lawmaker, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, came back to the hearings on Monday. His office released a letter from the Office of the Attending Physician clearing him to attend. -Nicholas Wu Biden says he's 'not a fan of court packing' Former Vice President Joe Biden told Cincinnati television station WKRC-TV on Monday he was “not a fan of court packing.” Biden said in the television interview he did not want to focus too much on the issue, though, added, “the president would love nothing better than to fight about whether or not I would in fact pack the court or not pack the court.” The potential expansion of the Supreme Court has become a flashpoint on the campaign trail. Some progressives suggested adding seats to the court if they win the presidency and Senate in November in response to Republicans’ nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to fill the late Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat. Conservatives hammered Biden over his evasion of questions on the topic. Biden had said he opposed expanding the size of the Supreme Court during the primary campaign but had evaded the question as the Democratic presidential nominee, saying last Friday voters “don’t deserve” to know his position on court expansion before the election. Congress can change the size of the Supreme Court if it passes legislation to do so and a president signs it into law. It has not changed the size of the Supreme Court since 1869, when the Judiciary Act of 1869 set the number of justices at nine. – Nicholas Wu The Amy Coney Barrett confirmation hearings: How to watch Viewers can watch Tuesday's confirmation hearing of Amy Coney Barrett in full at USATODAY.com.

Most of the networks will also provide uninterrupted coverage of the hearing online, through their streaming services, including CNN.com, C-SPAN.org and ABCnews.com. After giving their opening statements yesterday, Senators will question Barrett on her career and positions on issues that could come before the court. – Sarah Elbeshbishi Senators to question Amy Coney Barrett at Day 2 of hearings WASHINGTON – Senators are set to question President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett as the second day of the planned four days of confirmation hearings take place on Capitol Hill. Every senator will get to question Barrett for a half-hour, and the nominee is sure to face tough questions as she moves through the process to succeed Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham warned Monday of a \"long, contentious week\" ahead of the lawmakers. Democrats are likely to ask Barrett about health care, having settled on the topic as the focal point of their message as they oppose her nomination. Following Monday's hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, told reporters, \"we believe the Affordable Care Act is hanging in the balance on this decision of filling this vacancy on the Supreme Court. We're going to drive that issue home to our colleagues on the other side.\" Republicans aim to confirm Barrett to the Court before Election Day, but The Senate Judiciary Committee will not vote on Barrett's confirmation this week. The committee won’t vote until after it holds her nomination for one week, a common practice by the panel. The committee vote is expected around Oct. 22 and is likely to split along party lines, 12-10. Then her nomination will go to the full Senate, where she will need at least a majority to be confirmed to the high court. More: Pandemic, politics invade Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett More: How we got here: The battle over Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court, recapped Democrats acknowledge they lack the votes to block her confirmation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., told reporters no matter what obstacles Democrats threw up against the nomination process, \"to be honest, as good as we are, it's probably not going to change the trajectory of this nomination.\" Republicans, on the other hand, bat aside the criticism on health care, arguing the court makes decisions based on the law, not policy. \"It's pretty clear they want to talk about the Affordable Health Care Act in terms of policy. The judge will decide the merits based on the law,\" Graham told reporters. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said in an online news conference after the hearing that Democrats opposed Barrett because \"they're worried about is that having a constitutional jurist as the next justice on the Supreme Court\" who \"would block them from implementing Medicaid for all that is their goal they started out with Obamacare.\" The first day of hearings finished without many fireworks as Barrett gave her opening statement and senators spoke one-by-one. Republican senators and conservative activists said the Barrett hearings went well and said things appear to be on track for confirmation later this month. \"Judge Barrett did remarkably well,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, during a Zoom call with conservative organizations that are sponsoring ads and promoting Barrett's nomination. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., said Senate Democrats spent most of their time attacking President Donald Trump's desire to fill the court slot, saying little about Barrett's qualifications or record. \"They barely mentioned her name,\" Cruz said. Cruz and others on the call predicted to supporters that Barrett would soon become Justice Barrett. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said her organization and others are appealing up persuadable voters about the Barrett nomination. \"This will be an important piece on Election Day,\" she said. Democrats eschewed any attacks on Barrett's personal background, despite accusations from Republicans they were assailing the nominee's faith and background. \"We have taken an oath to a constitution that says no religious test,\" said Durbin. \"Enough said.\" Contributing: David Jackson, William Cummings, and Richard Wolf", "output": "left"}

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) says she could never imagine that militia groups would plot to kidnap her. She also said she believes the militia group members were encouraged by the country’s chief executive. On Thursday afternoon, Whitmer blasted President Donald Trump and accused him of “giving comfort to those who spread fear and hatred and division.” “Just last week, the President of the United States stood before the American people and refused to condemn white supremacists and hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups,” Whitmer said. She continued,”‘Stand back and stand by,’ he told them. ‘Stand back and stand by.’ Hate groups heard the President’s words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry. As a call to action. When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight. When our leaders meet with, encourage, or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions, and they are complicit.” “When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit,” she added.

Hate groups heard the President's words not as a rebuke, but as a rallying cry. As a call to action.\" pic.twitter.com/c0U5HdAh1T — The Hill (@thehill) October 8, 2020 The FBI announced on Thursday that it had arrested six individuals for allegedly plotting to kidnap Whitmer and attack the state government buildings. The plot also involved militia groups from the state. Whitmer’s comments about Trump refer to a moment from last week’s presidential debate when the president was asked to condemn far-right and white supremacist groups. During the debate, Trump was asked if he would condemn those groups, he said, “Sure. I would say almost everything I see is from the left-wing. Not from the right-wing. I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace.” When he asked for a specific group to condemn, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden threw out the Proud Boys group. Trump said, “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what, somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left. Because this is not a right-wing problem.” In case you missed the moment: https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1311128759563681793 After that debate, members of the far-right Proud Boys group shared posts on social media with Trump’s comments incorporated into the logo. Some terrorism experts said that the president’s comments legitimized the group. Rita Katz, executive director of SITE Intelligence Group, said, “He legitimized them in a way that nobody in the community expected. It’s unbelievable. The celebration is incredible.” “In my 20 years of tracking terrorism and extremism, I never thought I’d see anything like this from a U.S. president,” Katz added. However, later in the week, Trump said, “I’ve said it many times, and let me be clear again: I condemn the [Ku Klux Klan]. I condemn all white supremacists. I condemn the Proud Boys. I don’t know much about the Proud Boys, almost nothing.” He added, “But I condemn that.”", "output": "right"}

Pelosi, a California Democrat, contradicted reports that she held talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a measure that would provide $25 billion to the airlines, which have seen a steep decline in business due to the coronavirus and the subsequent stalling of the economy. “It’s not going to happen,” Pelosi told reporters who asked about the talks. “Ain’t going to be no stand-alone bill unless there is a bigger bill, and it could be part of that or in addition to that.” Democrats last week attempted to pass a bill to extend a payroll support program for airline workers, but the Republicans blocked it. Pelosi’s comments Thursday appear to dash hopes for a quick passage of a smaller coronavirus aid package. President Trump Wednesday called on Congress on Twitter to “IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, & 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business.” Trump said the funds would come from money left over from nearly $3 trillion in already-approved federal coronavirus aid. Trump appeared to reverse himself from a tweet earlier in the week in which he announced the White House was pulling out of talks with the Democrats, who he said were not negotiating “in good faith.” Pelosi, in talks with Mnuchin, has asked the Trump administration to agree to a $2.4-trillion package that includes money for state, local, and tribal governments, additional money for food stamps and rent control, and other spending provisions. House Democrats last week passed a pared-down version of a $3 trillion plan they approved in May. The latest Democratic version would cost $2.2 trillion. Talks between Mnuchin and Pelosi on a new round of federal coronavirus aid have dragged on for weeks, with little progress. “We are at the table.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has again updated its guidance about how Covid-19 spreads to include information about potential for airborne transmission. “CDC continues to believe, based on current science, that people are more likely to become infected the longer and closer they are to a person with COVID-19,” the agency said in a statement on Monday. “Today’s update acknowledges the existence of some published reports showing limited, uncommon circumstances where people with COVID-19 infected others who were more than 6 feet away or shortly after the COVID-19-positive person left an area. In these instances, transmission occurred in poorly ventilated and enclosed spaces that often involved activities that caused heavier breathing, like singing or exercise. Such environments and activities may contribute to the buildup of virus-carrying particles.” Still, the available data suggest “it is much more common for the virus that causes COVID-19 to spread through close contact with a person who has COVID-19 than through airborne transmission,” the new guidance says. How Covid-19 spreads The agency still says Covid-19 is thought to mainly spread through close contact between people – within 6 feet of each other. “When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. These droplets can range in size from larger droplets (some of which are visible) to smaller droplets,” the guidance says. “Small droplets can also form particles when they dry very quickly in the airstream.” But the CDC now says the virus can spread through small particles of virus that linger in the air and may be able to infect people more than 6 feet away. In enclosed spaces with poor ventilation, a person who was breathing heavily – while singing or exercising, for example – can infect people who aren’t nearby, even after the person with Covid-19 has left the space. The new guidance is also clear about asymptomatic transmission: “People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others,” it says. However, CDC says Covid-19 spreads “less commonly” through contact with contaminated surfaces, and “rarely” between people and animals. CDC says people can protect themselves from the coronavirus by staying 6 feet away from others, wearing a mask that covers the nose and mouth, washing hands frequently, cleaning surfaces and staying home when sick. CDC says previous guidance was posted in error Many researchers and doctors have said for months that coronavirus can be transmitted through small airborne viral particles. In July, 239 scientists published a letter that urged the World Health Organization and other public health organizations to be more forthcoming about the likelihood that people could catch the virus from droplets floating in the air. Some said they were encouraged last month when the agency updated its guidance to say Covid-19 could spread through the air. But days later, CDC abruptly reverted to its earlier guidance, which did not include information about airborne transmission. The agency said a draft version of proposed changes had been posted in error, and the guidance would be updated again once the scientific review process was completed. The unvetted post followed reports of interference in other CDC guidance and reports and sparked concerns about political pressure. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. “The fact that they retracted this, even though this is common scientific knowledge at this point, one has to wonder what’s behind it,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician at George Washington University and CNN medical analyst, said last month. “Was there political pressure? Political interference that’s driving this rather than science?” In a statement on Monday, CDC said its recommendations to prevent spread remained the same “based on existing science and after a thorough technical review of the guidance.” “The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus,” it says.", "output": "left"}

Upon walking out the doors of the hospital, he made a low fist pump and gave a thumbs up to the press as he got into a black SUV to head to Marine One. The president teased his return to the White House Monday afternoon, saying he is \"feeling really good!\" \"Don’t be afraid of Covid,\" the president tweeted. \"Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge.\" He added: \"I feel better than I did 20 years ago!\" Trump appeared to have his reelection campaign at the forefront of his thoughts shortly before departing Walter Reed, promising his followers on Twitter that he will be back on the stump soon and blasting polls that show him trailing Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Upon arriving to the White House, the president walked out on the balcony overlooking the South Lawn, surrounded by American flags, and saluted military officers and Marine One as it departed. The president arrived back to the White House after his physician, Dr. Sean Conley, hosted a press conference detailing the president’s progress and condition as he battles COVID-19. \"The president may not entirely be out of the woods yet,\" Conley said, but said that his \"clinical status supports the president’s safe return home,\" where he said he will be surrounded by medical staff “24/7.\" Conley added that the president met \"most of his discharge requirements\" on Sunday afternoon. \"We try to get patients out of the hospital as quickly as possible,\" Conley said. \"There is nothing being done here that we can’t safely do at home.” He added: \"We all remain cautiously optimistic and on guard because we’re in a bit of uncharted territory when it comes to a patient who received the therapies he has.” Conley added that HIPAA prevents him from discussing some details about the president's health. Another member of the president’s medical team said that his heart rate, as of Monday, was measured at 68 beats per minute, and that he had a 97% blood oxygen level. A normal blood oxygen reading is between 95 and 100%. Conley also told reporters Monday that the president has not been on fever-reducing medicine for over 72 hours. The medical team also said that the president does not have any “respiratory complaints,” and will receive his fourth round of Remdesivir before he departs Walter Reed Monday evening. The team said that the president will receive his final dose of Remdesivir at the White House on Tuesday. Conley stressed that Trump will receive \"world class medical care\" at the White House, saying \"we're not going to miss anything we would have caught up here,\" while maintaining that the president is “back.” The president was admitted to Walter Reed on Friday evening after experiencing what the White House, at the time, described as “mild symptoms.” Conley said that the president was \"a little dehydrated\" on Friday, upon being admitted to Walter Reed, and had a fever. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY KAYLEIGH MCENANY TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 On Friday, according to a White House official, there was “real concern” about his “vitals.” The president also has faced health scares throughout his battle with COVID-19, including two instances in which his blood oxygen level dropped suddenly. Doctors treated the president with a dose of the steroid dexamethasone in response. Conley said that Trump had a “high fever” and a blood oxygen level below 94% on Friday and during “another episode” on Saturday. But by Saturday, Conley said the president’s cardiac, kidney and liver functions were normal, and that the president was not on oxygen and was not having any difficulty breathing or walking. Conley said over the weekend that the president had received an antibody cocktail, as well as zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and a daily aspirin, along with his five-day course of Remdesivir. Meanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump, who also tested positive for COVID-19, tweeted Monday, saying she is \"feeling good.” “My family is grateful for all of the prayers & support!” she tweeted Monday. “I am feeling good & will continue to rest at home. \"Thank you to medical staff & caretakers everywhere, & my continued prayers for those who are ill or have a family member impacted by the virus,” the first lady added. Also on Monday, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced that she had tested positive for COVID-19. “After testing negative consistently, including every day since Thursday, I tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday morning while experiencing no symptoms,” McEnany said in a statement. “No reporters, producers or members of the press are listed as close contacts by the White House Medical Unit.” Other White House staff who have tested positive for COVID-19 at this point include senior adviser Hope Hicks and director of Oval Office operations Nick Luna. Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien also tested positive for COVID-19. Former counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway has also tested positive and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who participated in debate prep with the president recently, did too and was admitted to the hospital over the weekend. McEnany said Sunday that the White House would not be releasing the names or the exact number of staffers who have become infected with the novel coronavirus, citing privacy concerns. “There are privacy concerns,” McEnany said. “We take seriously safeguarding the information of personnel here in the White House.” The president and first lady announced they tested positive for COVID-19 early Friday, just before 1 a.m., after it was revealed that Hicks tested positive on Thursday.", "output": "right"}

As we've discussed, this isn't just the usual conspiratorial nonsense bubbling up from the right; it's vastly weirder, more radical, and more dangerous. Last year, the FBI went so far as to classify QAnon as a domestic-terror threat in an internal memo. As recently as July, the West Point Combating Terrorism Center published a study characterizing QAnon as a burgeoning threat to public safety. The delusional nonsense has become more politically relevant of late, in part because at least one of its adherents will soon be elected to Congress, in part because of the president's deeply unfortunate rhetoric on the matter, and in part because a House Democrat this week started receiving death threats from QAnon followers. It's against this backdrop that the House today decided to vote on a bipartisan resolution condemning the crackpot conspiracy theory. NPR reported: The House overwhelmingly approved a resolution condemning QAnon, the fringe movement that promotes wide-ranging conspiracies about the U.S. government and yet has enjoyed a rising tide inside conservative politics in part because of tacit encouragement from President Trump. At first blush, the fact that this resolution was easily approved may seem like a small victory for common sense, but the roll call highlights a nagging detail: the measure didn't pass unanimously. In fact, 17 House Republicans voted against it; one House Republican voted \"present,\" and 34 House Republicans didn't vote on the resolution at all. The Republicans who voted against the anti-QAnon resolution are Reps. Jodey Arrington, Michael Burgess, Bill Flores, and Brian Babin of Texas; Rob Bishop of Utah; Mo Brooks of Alabama; Buddy Carter and Drew Ferguson of Georgia; Warren Davidson of Ohio; Jeff Duncan and Ralph Norman of South Carolina; Paul Gosar of Arizona; Mike Kelly and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania; Tom Tiffany of Wisconsin; Daniel Webster of Florida; and Steve King of Iowa. So, on the one hand, it's good that most GOP lawmakers voted for the bipartisan measure. On the other hand, about a fourth of the House Republican conference didn't vote for it.", "output": "left"}

The death toll from the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, now stands at 1,000,555, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The grim tally has been reached in less than nine months since the first death caused by the coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities in the city of Wuhan. Since then, the virus has disrupted the everyday lives of billions of people around the globe and caused widespread economic damage. More than 33 million cases have been confirmed worldwide and outbreaks continue to plague many countries. Europe, which became the second epicenter for the virus after China, imposed widespread restrictions on people’s movements in the spring in an effort to curb its spread. While the measures had some success, a number of countries that were badly affected early on – such as France, Spain and the United Kingdom – are now battling to rein in a second wave. The United States, with more than 7 million cases and more than 205,000 deaths according to Johns Hopkins University data, has been the worst-affected nation overall. President Donald Trump is widely viewed as having mishandled the federal response to the pandemic and, despite the country’s wealth and advanced health care systems, it has struggled to bring infections under control. Now, some experts fear Trump could pressure scientists into authorizing or approving a Covid-19 vaccine without a full formal review process for political gain. Trump has repeatedly defended his handling of the pandemic. But he and the White House have been widely criticized for flouting government guidelines designed to limit the transmission of Covid-19, including social distancing and wearing a mask. Soaring infection rates On the other side of the world, India has surpassed 6 million confirmed coronavirus cases, making it the second worst-hit nation globally after the US. Although the number of reported cases had been steadily increasing since March, India’s epidemic intensified in June, when transmission began increasing at an exponential rate. It took almost six months for India to record 1 million cases on July 17. It added 4 million more in the space of just two months. More than 95,000 people have died with coronavirus, according to India’s health ministry. However, some scientists in India warn that the numbers are incomplete and misleading. Latin America has also seen increasing rates of coronavirus infection, with the number of confirmed cases soaring in recent weeks in Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. More than 141,000 people have died with coronavirus in Brazil, the second highest total in the world. Another 76,000 people have lost their lives to the virus in Mexico. Europe’s second wave So far, death rates in Europe’s second wave are still well below their peak in April. Experts warn, however, that the signs point to more tragedy ahead this winter. Measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing have become the norm and the latest spread of infection has been primarily among younger people, who are less likely to die if they contract the virus. But colder weather is beginning to set in and the flu season is approaching. The infection is spreading to older populations, and there are signs that people are growing tired of adhering to the restrictions. Hospitals are now better able to diagnose and treat the virus, meaning mortality rates for ICU patients in some European countries have dropped from about 50% during the spring to roughly 20%, Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the UK’s University of Southampton, told CNN. But Bulgaria, Croatia, Malta, Romania and Spain have all been seeing sustained death rate increases. Vaccine hopes Many around the world are pinning their hopes for a return to normal life on the swift development of a coronavirus vaccine. There are currently 35 vaccines in human trials around the world but no certainty as to when any will be approved for general use. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief science officer at the World Health Organization, warned that it could be 2022 before people can begin thinking about returning to “pre-Covid” life. Meanwhile the number of deaths from the coronavirus keeps growing. It took until the end of June for the global death toll to reach 500,000, but only three months since then (June 29) for that tally to double. The prospect of 2 million global deaths from Covid-19 is “certainly unimaginable … but it’s not impossible,” Dr. Mike Ryan, head of WHO’s emergencies program, said Friday. “(If) we look at losing a million people in nine months, and then we just look at the realities of getting a vaccine out there in the next nine months, it’s a big task for everyone involved.” The virus is proving hard to keep under control even in countries that saw early success in tamping down transmission. Back in April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu boasted that his country had shown the world how to contain coronavirus and he hoped it would show the world how to restart an economy emerging from lockdown. Now Israel is possibly the first in the world to impose a second general lockdown because of a resurgence of infections. A week into its second lockdown, Netanyahu announced a significant tightening of restrictions as cases continued to rise, including strict limits on protests and prayer groups and a wider closure of places of work. Other governments will hope to avoid following in that path as they battle to keep their populations safe and economies afloat. CNN’s Emma Reynolds contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

General Assembly on Tuesday, separately calling the virus \"The China Virus.\" US TO DECLARE UN SANCTIONS REIMPOSED ON IRAN DESPITE DISAGREEMENTS FROM ALLIES The administration has long blamed Beijing for its botched handling of the virus, which originated in Wuhan, China before becoming a worldwide pandemic, and has called on the international community to join in its own efforts to investigate China’s actions. “In the earliest days of the virus, China locked down travel domestically while allowing flights to leave China and infect the world,” Trump said, noting also its opposition to the travel restrictions he placed on China. The World Health Organization, from which the U.S. has begun withdrawing, was also under fire from the president for allegedly echoing talking points from the Chinese government -- information that turned out to be false. “The Chinese government, and the World Health Organization -- which is virtually controlled by China -- falsely declared that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission,” he said. “Later, they falsely said people without symptoms would not spread the disease.” CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC LIKELY 'COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED' IF CHINA, WHO ACTED DIFFERENTLY, REPORT SAYS He also contrasted China’s handling with that of America, who he said is leading the charge to find a vaccine and end the pandemic. \"We pioneered lifesaving treatments, reducing our fatality rate 85 percent since April. Thanks to our efforts, three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials,\" he said. \"We are mass-producing them in advance so they can be delivered immediately. Upon arrival, we will distribute the vaccine.\" Beyond the pandemic, he also called on the U.N. and others to focus on the “real problems” in the world and stop criticizing America on issues such as the environment. He said China's carbon emissions are twice as high as the U.S.' and accused it of dumping tons of plastic into the ocean and overfishing. “Those who attack America’s exceptional environmental record while ignoring China’s rampant pollution are not interested in the environment,” he said. “They only want to punish America. And I will not stand for it. \"If the United Nations is to be an effective organization, it must focus on the real problems of the world. This includes terrorism, the oppression of women, forced labor, drug trafficking, human and sex trafficking, religious persecution and the ethnic cleansing of religious minorities,\" he said. He also touted the recent peace agreements brokered by the U.S. in the Balkans and the Middle East.

Trump promised that his administration would deliver more deals \"shortly.\" He attributed the deals to his administration \"taking a different approach\" and said that as a result, it has achieved \"superior outcomes.\" Trump's pre-recorded speech, less than 10 minutes, is in contrast to the much longer addresses he has given at the world body in the past -- where world leaders gather in person to meet, discuss and speak in the large General Assembly Hall.

TikTok won’t face the most drastic sanctions until after the Nov. 3 election, but WeChat users could feel the effects as early as Sunday. The order, which cited national security and data privacy concerns, follows weeks of dealmaking over the video-sharing service TikTok. President Donald Trump has pressured the app’s Chinese owner to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to a domestic company to satisfy U.S. concerns over TikTok’s data collection and related issues. California tech giant Oracle recently struck a deal with TikTok along those lines, although details remain foggy and the administration is still reviewing it. Trump said Friday said he was open to a deal, noting that “we have some great options and maybe we can keep a lot of people happy,” suggesting that even Microsoft, which said its TikTok bid had been rejected, might continue to be involved, as well as Oracle and Walmart. Trump noted that TikTok was “very, very popular,” said “we have to have the total security from China,” and added that “we can do a combination of both.” The new order puts pressure on TikTok’s owner, ByteDance, to make further concessions, said James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Trump had said this week that he does not like the idea of ByteDance keeping majority control of TikTok. TikTok expressed “disappointment” over the move and said it would continue to challenge President Donald Trump’s “unjust executive order.” The Commerce Department is enacting an order announced by President Donald Trump in August. TikTok sued to stop that ban. WeChat owner Tencent said in an emailed statement that it will continue to discuss ways to address concerns with the government and look for long-term solutions. Google and Apple, the owners of the major mobile app stores, did not immediately reply to questions. Oracle also did not reply. “At the President’s direction, we have taken significant action to combat China’s malicious collection of American citizens’ personal data, while promoting our national values, democratic rules-based norms, and aggressive enforcement of U.S. laws and regulations,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a prepared statement. China’s ministry of commerce condemned the ban, and urged the U.S. to stop what it called bullying behavior and wrongdoing. It said China would “take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.” The action is the Trump administration’s latest attempt to counter the influence of China, a rising economic superpower. Since taking office in 2017, Trump has waged a trade war with China, blocked mergers involving Chinese companies and stifled the business of Chinese firms like Huawei, a maker of phones and telecom equipment. China-backed hackers, meanwhile, have been blamed for data breaches of U.S. federal databases and the credit agency Equifax, and the Chinese government strictly limits what U.S. tech companies can do in China. The order requires WeChat, which has millions of U.S. users who rely on the app to stay in touch and conduct business with people and companies in China, to end payments for business transactions through its service as of Sunday and prohibits it from obtaining vital technical services from vendors. The Justice Department said in a filing that it would not target users with criminal or civil penalties for messaging on the app. WeChat users have sued to stop the ban, and a federal judge in California on Friday set an emergency hearing for Saturday at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time. Similar technical limitations for TikTok don’t go into effect until Nov. 12, shortly after the U.S. election. Ross said early Friday on Fox Business Network that access to that app may be possible if certain safeguards are put into place. TikTok says it has 100 million U.S. users and 700 million globally. Nicholas Weaver, a computer science lecturer at UC Berkeley, said the actions taking effect Sunday are short-sighted and suggest that “the U.S. is not to be trusted and not a friendly place for business.” Users, meanwhile, face a security “nightmare” because they won’t be able to get app updates that fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, he said. The technical measures are “enforceable, the question is whether they are legal,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Lewis, likening them to a U.S. version of China’s “Great Firewall,” which censors its domestic internet. He said there could be a First Amendment challenge. Like most social networks, TikTok collects user data and moderates users’ posts. It grabs users’ locations and messages and tracks what they watch to figure out how best to target ads to them. Similar concerns apply to U.S.-based social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, but Chinese ownership adds an extra wrinkle because the Chinese government could demand cooperation from Chinese companies. The administration, however, has provided no specific evidence that TikTok has made U.S. users’ data available to the Chinese government. Some cybersecurity experts question whether the administration’s efforts are more political than rooted in legitimate concerns about Chinese threats to data security. “If there are direct national security threats, that information should be shared with the U.S. population,” said David Kennedy, CEO of cybersecurity firm TrustedSec, before the Commerce Department’s regulations were announced. “We’re not taking about what needs to happen policy-wise, we’re trying to hack this together to hurt China.” TikTok says it does not store U.S. user data in China and that it would not give user data to the government, and does not censor videos per dictates from China.", "output": "left"}

In a series of interviews with Woodward, Trump revealed that he had a surprising level of detail about the threat of the virus earlier than previously known. “Pretty amazing,” Trump told Woodward, adding that the coronavirus was maybe five times “more deadly” than the flu. Trump’s admissions are in stark contrast to his frequent public comments at the time insisting that the virus was “going to disappear” and “all work out fine.” The book, using Trump’s own words, depicts a President who has betrayed the public trust and the most fundamental responsibilities of his office. In “Rage,” Trump says the job of a president is “to keep our country safe.” But in early February, Trump told Woodward he knew how deadly the virus was, and in March, admitted he kept that knowledge hidden from the public. “I wanted to always play it down,” Trump told Woodward on March 19, even as he had declared a national emergency over the virus days earlier. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.” If instead of playing down what he knew, Trump had acted decisively in early February with a strict shutdown and a consistent message to wear masks, social distance and wash hands, experts believe that thousands of American lives could have been saved. The startling revelations in “Rage,” which CNN obtained ahead of its September 15 release, were made during 18 wide-ranging interviews Trump gave Woodward from December 5, 2019 to July 21, 2020. The interviews were recorded by Woodward with Trump’s permission, and CNN has obtained copies of some of the audio tapes. “Rage” also includes brutal assessments of Trump’s presidency from many of his former top national security officials, including former Defense Secretary James Mattis, former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mattis is quoted as calling Trump “dangerous” and “unfit” to be commander in chief. Woodward writes that Coats “continued to harbor the secret belief, one that had grown rather than lessened, although unsupported by intelligence proof, that Putin had something on Trump.” Woodward continues, writing that Coats felt, “How else to explain the president’s behavior? Coats could see no other explanation.” The book also contains harsh evaluations of the President’s leadership on the virus from current officials. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the administration’s top infectious disease expert, is quoted telling others Trump’s leadership was “rudderless” and that his “attention span is like a minus number.” “His sole purpose is to get reelected,” Fauci told an associate, according to Woodward. Fauci responded to the quotes in a Fox News interview on Wednesday, saying he would question the account. “If you notice, others have said that. You know, you should ask others. I don’t recall that at all,” Fauci said, adding that he “didn’t get any sense” Trump was distorting things. Trump responded to the Woodward book at a White House event Wednesday afternoon, defending his response to the pandemic and confirming he did not want to create a panic. “Well, I think if you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that’s so,” Trump said. “The fact is I’m a cheerleader for this country. I love our country. And I don’t want people to be frightened. I don’t want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength.” ‘The virus has nothing to do with me’ Woodward reveals new details on the early warnings Trump received – and often ignored. In a January 28 top secret intelligence briefing, national security adviser Robert O’Brien gave Trump a “jarring” warning about the virus, telling the President it would be the “biggest national security threat” of his presidency. Trump’s head “popped up,” Woodward writes. O’Brien’s deputy, Matt Pottinger, concurred, telling Trump it could be as bad as the influenza pandemic of 1918, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including 675,000 Americans. Pottinger warned Trump that asymptomatic spread was occurring in China: He had been told 50% of those infected showed no symptoms. At that time, there were fewer than a dozen reported coronavirus cases in the US. Three days later, Trump announced restrictions on travel from China, a move suggested by his national security team – despite Trump’s later claims that he alone backed the travel limitations. Nevertheless, Trump continued to publicly downplay the danger of the virus. February was a lost month. Woodward views this as a damning missed opportunity for Trump to reset “the leadership clock” after he was told this was a “once-in-a-lifetime health emergency.” “Presidents are the executive branch. There was a duty to warn. To listen, to plan, and to take care,” Woodward writes. But in the days following the January 28 briefing, Trump used high-profile appearances to minimize the threat and, Woodward writes, “to reassure the public they faced little risk.” During a pre-Super Bowl interview on Fox News February 2, Trump said, “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.” Two days later during his State of the Union address, Trump made only a passing reference to the virus, promising, “my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.” Asked by Woodward in May if he remembered O’Brien’s January 28 warning that the virus would be the biggest national security threat of his presidency, Trump equivocated. “No, I don’t.” Trump said. “I’m sure if he said it — you know, I’m sure he said it. Nice guy.” The book highlights how the President took all of the credit and none of the responsibility for his actions related to the pandemic, which has infected 6 million Americans and killed more than 185,000 in the US. “The virus has nothing to do with me,” Trump told Woodward in their final interview in July. “It’s not my fault. It’s — China let the damn virus out.” ‘It goes through the air’ When Woodward spoke to Trump on February 7, two days after he was acquitted on impeachment charges by the Senate, Woodward expected a lengthy conversation about the trial. He was surprised, however, by the President’s focus on the virus. At the same time that Trump and his public health officials were saying the virus was “low risk,” Trump divulged to Woodward that the night before he’d spoken to Chinese President Xi Jinping about the virus. Woodward quotes Trump as saying, “We’ve got a little bit of an interesting setback with the virus going in China.” “It goes through the air,” Trump said. “That’s always tougher than the touch. You don’t have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed. And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” But Trump spent most of the next month saying that the virus was “very much under control” and that cases in the US would “disappear.” Trump said on his trip to India on February 25 that it was “a problem that’s going to go away,” and the next day he predicted the number of US cases “within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.” By March 19, when Trump told Woodward he was purposely downplaying the dangers to avoid creating a panic, he also acknowledged the threat to young people. “Just today and yesterday, some startling facts came out. It’s not just old, older. Young people too, plenty of young people,” Trump said. Publicly, however, Trump has continued to insist just the opposite, saying as recently as August 5 that children were “almost immune.” Even into April, when the US became the country with the most confirmed cases in the world, Trump’s public statements contradicted his acknowledgements to Woodward. At an April 3 coronavirus task force briefing, Trump was still downplaying the virus and stating that it would go away. “I said it’s going away and it is going away,” he said. Yet two days later on April 5, Trump again told Woodward, “It’s a horrible thing. It’s unbelievable,” and on April 13, he said, “It’s so easily transmissible, you wouldn’t even believe it.” ‘Dangerous’ and ‘unfit’ Woodward, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, conducted hundreds of hours of confidential background interviews with firsthand witnesses for “Rage,” and he obtained “notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents,” including more than two dozen letters Trump exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Woodward is known to record his interviews with the permission of his subjects and sources. He writes that when he attributes exact quotations, thoughts or conclusions, that information comes either from the person, a colleague with direct knowledge or documents. Trump’s conscious downplaying of the coronavirus is one of numerous revelations in “Rage.” The book is filled with anecdotes about top Cabinet officials blindsided by tweets, frustrated with Trump’s inability to focus and scared about his next policy directive because he refused to accept facts or listen to experts: – Mattis is quoted as saying Trump is “dangerous,” “unfit,” has “no moral compass” and took foreign policy actions that showed adversaries “how to destroy America.” After Mattis left the administration, he and Coats discussed whether they needed to take “collective action” to speak out publicly against Trump. Mattis says he ultimately resigned after Trump announced he was withdrawing US troops from Syria, “when I was basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid.” – Woodward writes that Coats and his top staff members “examined the intelligence as carefully as possible,” and that Coats still questions the relationship between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “Coats saw how extraordinary it was for the president’s top intelligence official to harbor such deep suspicions about the president’s relationship with Putin. But he could not shake them.” – Trump has come under fire in recent days for reportedly making disparaging remarks about US military personnel and veterans. Woodward’s book includes an anecdote where an aide to Mattis heard Trump say in a meeting, “my f—ing generals are a bunch of pussies” because they cared more about alliances than trade deals. Mattis asked the aide to document the comment in an email to him. And Trump himself criticized military officials to Woodward over their view that alliances with NATO and South Korea are the best bargain the US makes. “I wouldn’t say they were stupid, because I would never say that about our military people,” Trump said. “But if they said that, they – whoever said that was stupid. It’s a horrible bargain … they make so much money. Costs us $10 billion. We’re suckers.” – Woodward reports that Trump’s national security team expressed concerns the US may have come close to nuclear war with North Korea amid provocations in 2017. “We never knew whether it was real,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is quoted as saying, “or whether it was a bluff.” But it was so serious that Mattis slept in his clothes to be ready in case there was a North Korean launch and repeatedly went to the Washington National Cathedral to pray. – Trump boasted to Woodward about a new secret weapons system. “I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before,” Trump said. Woodward says other sources confirmed the information, without providing further details, but expressed surprise that Trump disclosed it. – Woodward obtained the 27 “love letters” Trump exchanged with Kim Jong Un, 25 of which have not been reported publicly. The letters, filled with flowery language, provide a fascinating window into their relationship. Kim flatters Trump by repeatedly calling him “Your Excellency,” and writes in one letter that meeting again would be “reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film.” In another, Kim writes that the “deep and special friendship between us will work as a magical force.” CNN has obtained the transcripts of two of the letters. – Trump’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser Jared Kushner also weighs in with some unusual literary insights about his father-in-law. Kushner is quoted as saying that four texts are key to understanding Trump, including “Alice in Wonderland.” Kushner paraphrased the Cheshire Cat: “If you don’t know where you’re going, any path will get you there.” – Woodward pressed Trump on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s role in the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Once again, Trump dismissed the US intelligence assessment and defends bin Salman: “He says very strongly that he didn’t do it.” – Trump insulted his predecessors, saying Woodward made former President George W. Bush “look like a stupid moron, which he was.” Trump said of former President Barack Obama: “I don’t think Obama’s smart … I think he’s highly overrated. And I don’t think he’s a great speaker.” He also tells Woodward that Kim Jong Un thought Obama was an “asshole.” – Woodward discussed the Black Lives Matter protests and suggested to the President that people like the two of them – “White, privileged” – need to work to understand the anger and pain that Black people feel in the US. “You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn’t you? Just listen to you,” Trump responded, repeating his outrageous talking point that he’s done more for the Black community than any president besides Abraham Lincoln. – Woodward reports new details on Russia’s election meddling, writing that the NSA and CIA have classified evidence the Russians had placed malware in the election registration systems of at least two Florida counties, St. Lucie and Washington. While there was no evidence the malware had been activated, Woodward writes, it was sophisticated and could erase voters in specific districts. The voting system vendor used by Florida was also used in states across the country. ‘Dynamite behind the door’ “Rage” is a follow-up to Woodward’s 2018 bestselling book “Fear,” which portrayed a chaotic White House in which aides hid papers from Trump to protect the country from what they viewed as his most dangerous impulses. While Trump slammed “Fear,” he also complained that he didn’t speak to Woodward for the book, which resulted in his agreeing to extensive interviews for “Rage.” However, on August 14, Trump preemptively attacked Woodward’s new book, tweeting, “The Bob Woodward book will be a FAKE, as always, just as many of the others have been.” Throughout the book, Trump provides insights into his view of the presidency. He tells Woodward when you’re running the country, “There’s dynamite behind every door.” After his 18 interviews, Woodward issues a stark verdict: Trump is the “dynamite behind the door.” Woodward concludes his book with a declaration that “Trump is the wrong man for the job.” This story has been updated.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the White House’s coronavirus response team, came to President Donald Trump’s defense late Wednesday, telling Fox News that he does not believe Trump intentionally “distorted” information about the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier Wednesday, veteran journalist Bob Woodward released excerpts of his forthcoming book on the president — excerpts that came from nearly 20 hours of conversation with Trump — including a passage that suggests Trump deliberately downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic in order to tamp down Americans’ panic. Trump reportedly said he “wanted to always play it [the pandemic] down. I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic,” according to Woodward. Trump added, the book contends, that he did not understand the true extent of the virus’s impact when the first reports of coronavirus emerged in late January and early February. Trump defended the comment, noting in a press conference that he was referring to how he handled public statements about the ongoing pandemic, controlling his comments so that he did not incite unwarranted panic. “The fact is, I’m a cheerleader for this country,” Trump said. “I love our country, and I don’t want people to be frightened.” “We don’t want to instill panic,” the president added. “We don’t want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem that is a tremendous problem.” Fauci, whom the media have often portrayed as at odds with the president over how to handle the COVID-19 outbreak that nearly brought the nation to a three-month standstill, stepped to the president’s defense on Wednesday, telling Fox News that the president never deliberately distorted information that he was given about the pandemic and that Trump delivered remarks on the virus consistent with what his top advisors were telling him about COVID-19. “I didn’t get any sense that he was distorting anything,” Fauci said. “I mean in my discussions with him, they were always straightforward about the concerns that we had. We related that to him. And when he would go out, I’d hear him discussing the same sort of things. He would often say, ‘We just got through with a briefing with the group from the task force,’ and would talk about it. So it may have happened, but I have not seen that kind of distortion.” Fauci also insisted that Trump did not break with his advisors when it came to how to handle the public face of the White House’s coronavirus efforts. “I don’t recall anything different than in our discussions that we had with the president that he said things quite similar publicly,” Fauci said. “I didn’t really go over any of the text since it just came out,” Fauci said, referring to Woodward’s claims. “But you know, in my discussions and the discussions of other task force members with the president, we’re talking about the reality of what was going on.” “And then when we would get up in front of the press conferences, which were very, very common after our discussions with the president, he really didn’t say anything different than we discussed when we were with him,” Fauci continued, per Fox News. “I may not be tuned in to the right thing that they’re talking about. But, I didn’t see any discrepancies between what he told us and what we told him, and what he came out publicly and said.” Woodward also claims Fauci impugned the president’s attention span, a claim Fauci refuted. “I don’t recall that at all,” Fauci said.", "output": "right"}

Crews were conducting active rescue operations to save people surrounded by the flames. “It’s a little unnerving because September and October are historically our worst months for fires,” Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff told The Associated Press. “It’s usually hot, and the fuels really dry out. And we see more of our wind events.” Tolmachoff said the new record was so striking because of how early it was set. The previous record was set just two years ago and included the deadliest fire in state history, the Camp Fire that roared through Paradise in November 2018 and killed 85 people. Two of the three largest fires in state history are burning in the San Francisco Bay Area. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling those fires and about two dozen others around California. In the central part of the state, the explosive Creek Fire has grown to more than 135,000 acres in just three days after erupting over the weekend. Cal Fire said the blaze remains 0% contained and continues to grow under \"extreme fire conditions.\" At least 65 structures have been destroyed as evacuations remain in the area. Fresno County Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Purcell told the Fresno Bee on Monday the fire was “an unprecedented disaster for Fresno County.” GENDER-REVEAL PYROTECHNIC SPARKED MASSIVE EL DORADO FIRE Fire officials said Monday night that at least one death had been reported in the area due to the blaze, but officials later told FOX26 an elderly man collapsed due to a medical episode and was not related to the fire. On Saturday, National Guard rescuers in two military helicopters airlifted 214 people to safety after flames trapped them in a wooded camping area near Mammoth Pool Reservoir. Two people were seriously injured and were among 12 hospitalized. On Monday night, a military helicopter tried but failed to land near Lake Edison to rescue people trapped by the fire, the Fresno Fire Department said on Twitter. The department tweeted that “military pilots tried valiantly to land but heavy smoke conditions prevented a safe approach, another effort will be made shortly to evacuate the trapped people in Lake Edison and China Peak using night vision.\" Chief Warrant Officer Joseph Rosamond, the pilot of a Chinook helicopter, told the Associated Press visibility was poor and winds increasingly strong during the three flights he made into the fire zone during the operation that started late Saturday and stretched into Sunday. His crew relied on night-vision goggles to search for a landing spot near a boat launch where flames came within 50 feet of the aircraft. The injured, along with women and children, took priority on the first airlift, which filled both helicopters to capacity, he said. “We started getting information about how many people were out there, how many people to expect, and that number kept growing. So we knew that it was a dire situation,” Rosamond said. Hundreds of campers were trapped over the Labor Day holiday weekend by the explosive blaze. Jeremy Remington was camping at Mammoth Pool Reservoir with his family celebrating his mother's retirement when they found themselves surrounded by the wildfire. Videos taken by Remington show them first unsuccessfully attempting to escape by boat, and then eventually being rescued by helicopter. The footage also shows the scorched landscape around them. The fire danger also is high in Southern California, where new fires were burning in Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The U.S. Forest Service on Monday decided to close all eight national forests in the region and to shutter campgrounds statewide. CLICK HERE FOR MORE WEATHER COVERAGE FROM FOX NEWS “Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough resources to fully fight and contain every fire,\" Randy Moore, regional forester for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region that covers California, told the AP. More than 14,000 firefighters are battling blazes at around two dozen wildfires around the state. California has seen 900 wildfires since Aug. 15, many of them started by an intense series of thousands of lightning strikes in mid-August. There have been at least eight confirmed fire deaths and more than 3,300 structures destroyed.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Rochester police leaders retire after suffocation death Rochester police leaders retire after suffocation death Top police leaders in Rochester, New York, announced their retirements Tuesday amid nightly protests over the handling of the suffocation death of Daniel Prude, whose family filed a federal lawsuit alleging a cover-up by law enforcement. Police Chief La’Ron Singletary, Deputy Chief Joseph M. Morabito and two commanders retired, while two more deputy chiefs and a commander gave up top leadership positions and returned to lower ranks. The outgoing chief accused critics of trying to “destroy my character and integrity.” Mayor Lovely Warren said during a video call with members of the City Council that she did not ask Singletary, 40, to resign, but that his abrupt decision to step down came after “new information that was brought to light today that I had not previously seen before.” She did not elaborate. While the “timing and tenor” of the retirements were difficult, Warren said later at a brief news conference, “I truly believe that we will get through this.” The sudden announcements came more than five months after the death of Prude, a 41-year-old Black man who died several days after an encounter with police March 23 in New York’s third-largest city. There have been nightly protests in the city since the video’s release Wednesday. “The events that have unfolded today have taken us completely by surprise, as they have everyone else,” the Rochester police union, known as the Locust Club, said in a prepared statement. The union blamed the “problems of leadership” on the mayor. “The members of the Rochester Police Department and the Greater Rochester Community know my reputation and know what I stand for,” Singletary said in his own prepared statement. “The mischaracterization and the politicization of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr. Prude’s death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for.” Singletary, who spent his entire career in the Rochester Police Department, was appointed chief in April 2019. He will stay on through the end of the month, Warren said. Both the mayor and Singletary are Black. “This is great news,” said Iman Abid, speaking for Free the People ROC, which has held protests since details of Prude’s death emerged. “It says to the people that people are able to move things and to shape things. The police chief wouldn’t retire if it weren’t for something that he felt he was accountable to.” But, she said, nightly protests will continue to push other demands, including the resignation of the mayor, defunding and demilitarizing of police, and development of a state law barring police departments from responding to mental health crises. Officers found Prude running naked down the street in March, handcuffed him and put a hood over his head to stop him from spitting, then held him down for about two minutes until he stopped breathing. He died a week later after he was taken off life support. His brother, Joe Prude, had called 911 seeking help for Daniel Prude’s unusual behavior. He had been taken to a hospital for a mental health evaluation earlier that night but was released after a few hours, his brother told officers. His death sparked outrage after his relatives last week released police body camera video and written reports they obtained through a public records request. Seven police officers were suspended a day later, and state Attorney General Letitia James said Saturday she would form a grand jury and conduct an “exhaustive investigation” into Prude’s death. In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday, Prude’s family alleged that it took more than 90 seconds for officers to notice he had stopped breathing because they were chatting and making jokes at his expense. Prude’s sister, Tameshay, sued as executor of his estate and named the city of Rochester, Singletary and officers involved in the arrest as defendants. Prude’s family contends his death and a cover-up stem from longstanding police department policy and practice that “condones and encourages officers to use excessive force as a matter of course, and to lie in official police paperwork and sworn testimony to justify their unlawful actions.” The lawsuit alleges the police department sought to cover up the true nature of Prude’s death, starting with what Warren said was Singletary reporting to her early on that Prude had an apparent drug overdose. The lawsuit also argues officers used force against Prude at a time when he “obviously posed no threat to the safety of the officers or anyone else.” “Mr. Prude was in the midst of an acute, manic, psychotic episode,” the lawsuit states. “Mr. Prude was unarmed, naked and suffering. He needed help.” Police union officials have said the officers were following their training.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Michael Forest Reinoehl, a self-described anti-fascist who said he provided security for Portland racial justice protests, appears to have targeted a participant in a pro-Trump rally, emerging from an alcove of a parking garage before firing two gunshots, one that hit the man’s bear spray can and the other that proved fatal, according to a police affidavit unsealed Friday. Police found a single Winchester .380-caliber bullet casing on the street, a metal canister of “Bear Attack Detector” that had a “large defect” in it and a collapsible metal baton just north of Aaron “Jay” Danielson’s body, a detective said in the affidavit. Danielson, 39, was pronounced dead at 8:55 p.m. last Saturday on Southwest Third Avenue, about 10 minutes after the shooting was reported. He died from a single bullet to the upper right chest, an autopsy found. The bullet was found lodged in his back. During a search of Reinoehl’s basement rental unit in a Northeast Portland house on 92nd Avenue, police found ammunition of the same caliber used in Danielson’s shooting and clothing Reinoehl wore that night, prosecutors said. The search didn’t appear to have turned up the gun used. Portland police obtained a warrant Thursday afternoon charging Reinoehl with second-degree murder with a weapon and unlawful use of a weapon. That night, four officers from three different Washington agencies shot at Reinoehl after he walked out of an apartment outside Lacey, Washington, and tried to flee as they moved in to arrest him. Reinoehl was hit multiple times and died at the scene. He had a handgun but Washington investigators said it’s not clear yet whether he fired it. On Friday afternoon, a judge unsealed the affidavits for his arrest warrant and a warrant for the search of Reinoehl’s residence. The documents offer new details of the deadly encounter between Reinoehl and Danielson shortly after a car caravan in support of President Trump had left Portland’s downtown last weekend. Several witnesses told police they saw Danielson holding a can of mace or bear spray and then heard two shots, the affidavit said. Police found damage to the bear spray canister that was retrieved from the street, leading investigators to believe it was struck by the first of two bullets fired by Reinoehl. Police slowed down video captured by a livestreamer of the shooting and said it appeared that a shot was fired, followed by an explosion of the chemical and then a quick second gunshot, the affidavit said. Danielson stumbled two or three steps before collapsing in the street. Detectives found a loaded 9mm handgun on Danielson’s waistband and three magazines of 9mm red-tip ammunition in his right cargo pants pocket, the affidavit said. Surveillance video from the nearby Third Avenue parking garage showed Danielson holding a baton in his left hand and the bear spray in his right hand before the shooting, according to police. Reinoehl is seen hiding in an alcove of the garage and reaching into a pouch or waistband as Danielson and a friend, Chandler Pappas, walk south on Third Avenue. Homicide Detective Rico Beniga wrote that Reinoehl “conceals himself, waits and watches” as Danielson and Pappas pass him. After the two men go by, Reinoehl followed them, walking west across the street moments before the gunshots were fired, police said. Investigators said it appeared as if Reinoehl stood holding his gun with both hands extended when he fired. After the shots, his right hand remained extended and pointed at Danielson before he turned to run away, police said. Both Danielson and Pappas were wearing Patriot Prayer hats, signifying their support of the right-wing group based in Vancouver. Pappas told police that he and Danielson had been drinking earlier in the evening and were facing off with Reinoehl and a man who was with him when the gunshots occurred. A witness told police he heard one of the men confronting Danielson and Pappas say something like, “We’re going to (expletive) kill you,” the affidavit said. Justin Dunlap, who caught the shooting on his livestream video, said he heard Reinoehl or the man near him say something similar to “You wanna go.” A motorist driving by told police he saw a Black man in the area say “Hey, there’s the guy.” A third witness said Reinoehl “peeked out” of the alcove as Danielson and Pappas went by before approaching them, according to the affidavit. As part of the investigation, police learned that Reinoehl had sent a text message to his teenage son on Aug. 7 that read, “Sell me the gun for a quarter pound of weed and $100 I’m getting tired of this shit I need a piece now,” according to the affidavit. Reinoehl was identified on social media within hours of the shooting. His younger sister also told detectives that the man seen in the footage was Reinoehl. Police had seized a gun from Reinoehl during an early morning protest downtown on July 5, but it was of a different caliber than the one used to shoot Danielson, according to the affidavit. Reinoehl was given a citation then, accused of possessing a loaded gun in a public place, resisting arrest and interfering with police on Southwest Main Street. Police took a Walther 9mm semi-automatic handgun from Reinoehl. The citation was dropped by the Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office on July 30, and Reinoehl spent no time behind bars. The office earlier this week said it was still reviewing the case. Rienoehl described himself on social media as “100 % ANTIFA” but later said in an interview that he wasn’t a member of antifa or other groups. He appeared to admit in the report published by Vice News on Thursday that he fired the shots at Danielson. He said he acted in self-defense, believing he and a friend of his were about to be maced or stabbed, was aware of what he did and ran from the scene. “I had no choice,” he told the interviewer, then added, “I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color, but I wasn’t going to do that.” Reinoehl also said lawyers advised him against saying anything, but that “I feel it’s important that the world at least gets a little bit of what’s really going on, because there’s been a lot of propaganda put out.” Portland police also Friday asked for the public’s help in identifying a man who was with Reinoehl on Saturday night at the time of the shooting, wearing a black hood, mask and sweatshirt. Detectives said they’re still interested in interviewing the man who also ran from the scene. They ask that anyone with information on his identity contact Detective Beniga at 503-823-0457 or rico.beniga@portlandoregon.gov. Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt said in a statement that investigators in Washington state also are trying to find out more about what led to Reinoehl’s death. “The loss of life is tragic,” Schmidt said in a statement. “It has a profound impact on families, friends and community members. The apprehension of a fugitive, in particular one under investigation for murder, is especially dangerous for law enforcement. I am thankful that no one else was injured or killed during last night’s incident in Lacey, Washington, and I appreciate the coordination between law enforcement agencies throughout this investigation.” -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Markey Fends Off Kennedy Challenge In High Profile Mass. Senate Primary Updated at 11:30 p.m. ET Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey has fended off the highest-profile Democratic primary challenge of his decades in federal office, defeating the rising Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a member of the state's legendary political dynasty. Kennedy conceded the contest nearly two and a half hours after polls closed Tuesday night. The Associated Press projected Markey as the winner a short time later. Prior to this race, no member of the Kennedy family had lost an election in Massachusetts, according to the Cook Political Report. Markey's victory means the 74-year-old incumbent, who became a Massachusetts congressman before the 39-year-old Kennedy was born, advances to November's general election and will likely continue to represent the solidly liberal state in the Senate for another six years, while Kennedy — at least for a time — will be out of Congress, since state law prohibited him from running for reelection to his House seat and in the Senate primary at the same time. Loading... The outcome adds a new twist to an emerging narrative in Democratic politics. Over the last two years, young progressive challengers have toppled well-known longtime incumbents in places like St. Louis and New York City. In the Massachusetts race, though, it was Markey who received support from progressive figures and organizations for his reelection, and his challenger, Kennedy, whose famous surname boosted his name recognition. Indeed, before Kennedy even entered the race, polling found him to be the favorite — and some analysts were counting Markey out. But Markey ran up big margins in Boston and many of its well-heeled surrounding communities, eclipsing Kennedy's advantages in more working-class cities. Speaking from his hometown of Malden, Mass., Markey acknowledged the young voices who energized his winning campaign. \"Tonight is more than just a celebration of a movement; it is a reaffirmation of the need to have a movement — a progressive movement of young people,\" he said. Both Markey and Kennedy mentioned the sometimes contentious nature of their primary. \"The senator is a good man. You have never heard me say otherwise,\" Kennedy told supporters after conceding. \"It was difficult at times between us. Good elections often get heated. But I'm grateful for the debates, for his commitment to our commonwealth and for the energy and enthusiasm that he brought to this race. Obviously, these results were not the ones we were hoping for.\" Two well-liked Democrats square off Kennedy's bold challenge of the incumbent rubbed many of the states voters the wrong way, and some Democrats, including former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank, bemoaned the fact that the primary would take resources and focus away from the party's efforts to topple Republicans in races elsewhere. During the campaign, Kennedy was often asked to explain why he was taking on Markey, since the two agree on most major policy issues. Kennedy would say it was time for new leadership, and that being one of the state's senators means more than just how that politician votes. \"For most who are struggling and scraping and striving across our commonwealth, the status quo doesn't come close [to helping them],\" Kennedy said this past weekend, according to WBUR. \"And we will not change that by doing the same thing we've been doing for 50 years: by entrusting our future to the same people who built our past.\" Markey stressed his working-class roots, legislative accomplishments and progressive credentials, especially on climate change with his co-authorship of the Green New Deal with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who endorsed him. (Kennedy also supports the Green New Deal.) \"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right when she says, 'It's not a question of your age; it's the age of your ideas,' \" Markey told reporters this past weekend. \"If [this campaign is about] ideas, I'm the youngest guy in this race.\" Kennedy, a former Peace Corps volunteer who speaks Spanish fluently, tried to counter by pointing to Markey's vote to authorize the Iraq war and his record on criminal justice, including his vote for the 1994 crime bill — positions now out of step with the party's progressives. Markey was backed by his progressive colleague, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and his campaign's quirky digital presence boosted his appeal with young people. (Team Kennedy complained of online harassment from some Markey supporters.) Markey reportedly outspent Kennedy nearly four to one on ads in the Boston market in the final week of the campaign. The incumbent topped the final several polls in the race, led by support among young voters, white residents and college-educated liberals. Kennedy, meanwhile, polled stronger among moderates, nonwhite voters and voters without a college degree. Markey now faces Kevin O'Connor, the winner of the Republican primary, in November. Another longtime Massachusetts incumbent, 1st Congressional District Rep. Richard Neal, also fended off a younger challenger on Tuesday.", "output": "left"}

Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include additional details about methodology. President Donald Trump's efforts to build his appeal and define his opponent at the Republican National Convention, using pageantry and the White House as the backdrop, had little apparent impact on the electorate's impressions of both him and former Vice President Joe Biden, a new ABC News/Ipsos poll finds. Trump's week of celebration did not improve his favorability, even among his own base, and the country still remains widely critical of his handling of the major crisis of his presidency: COVID-19. Less than one-third (31%) of the country has a favorable view of the president in the days after he accepted the Republican nomination for the second time -- a stagnant reality for Trump. His favorability rating stood at 32% in the last poll, taken a week earlier, right after the Democratic National Convention. Trump finds himself in a much different position than his chief rival. In the new survey, which was conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel, Biden's favorability remains higher than his unfavorability, 46% to 40%, solidifying his improvement in favorability from last week, when attitudes about the Democratic nominee improved to a net positive from his slightly underwater position prior to the convention. Biden's favorability ticked up from 40% in an Aug. 13 poll to 45% just after the Democratic convention. Among Democrats, too, Biden's favorability climbed seven points after his convention -- showing signs that he's solidified support among his base. But Trump's favorability dipped slightly -- by four points among Republicans in the newest survey. At the GOP's gathering, the president sought to frame his response to the virus, the most pressing issue his administration faces, before a mostly mask-free audience. His speech, however, appears to have done little to shift the consistent disapproval on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. A clear majority of Americans (63%) disapprove of Trump's oversight of the public health crisis -- a steady trend since early July. Approval for his leadership on COVID-19 continues to hover in the low- to mid-30s, tracking his overall favorability rating. Pertaining to the other crisis facing the nation -- racial justice -- Republicans, including Trump, sought to frame the debate over the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests across the nation in the context of \"law and order\" throughout the last week. They rarely mentioned George Floyd, the Black man who was killed by police officers in Minneapolis and sparked nationwide demonstrations, or the more recent shooting of Jacob Blake, who was shot seven times by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Most Americans (62%) view the incident with Blake, which has left him paralyzed from the waist down, as a sign of broader problems in the treatment of African Americans by police. But that number is not as stark as the 74% who said the same in the wake of the killing of Floyd. The downward trend is driven by a decline across ideological and racial groups, but most sharply among Republicans and white Americans. The last time this question was posed by ABC News/Ipsos was in early June, when 55% of Republicans and 70% of whites said the fatal incident involving Floyd was a sign of a broader problematic pattern. Now, only 27% of Republicans and 52% of whites say the same, a decrease of 28 and 18 points, respectively. Taken together, the last two weeks set up a general election between an incumbent ticket facing a favorability deficit, while views of the Democratic ticket have bounced into positive territory during the convention season. Similar to Trump, Pence saw little movement in his favorable numbers, with 31% viewing him positively, while nearly half of Americans (49%) have an unfavorable view of him. Support among Republicans also didn't move, with roughly 7 in 10 perceiving him favorably before and after the Republican convention. Biden's vice presidential nominee, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is steadily rising in her favorables, with 43% giving her strong marks in this poll, compared to 41% last week and 35% right before the Democratic convention. Just over one-third (34%) have a negative view of Harris. Much like the Democratic convention, nearly 3 in 4 Americans (72%) said they watched either very little or none of the GOP's marquee event on TV or online this past week. Only 28% said they watched at least some of it, on par with Democrats garnering 30% for their virtual gathering. In 2016, about two-thirds of the country (64%) said they watched at least some of the Republican National Convention, when Trump first accepted his party's nomination amid chaotic scenes on the convention floor, according to a Gallup poll. Only 36% said they watched very little or none of it. The question from Gallup did not include \"online,\" unlike the ABC News/Ipsos poll, which sought to catch a possibly broader audience. While a majority (53%) approved of Democrats' messaging and programming at their convention, only 37% said the same about the Republican gathering. Just under 6 in 10 Americans (59%) disapproved of the RNC. Only 34% of the country felt that this year's GOP convention maintained the right balance between criticizing Democrats and touting their own party's achievements, compared to 45% who believed the same about the Democrats following their convention. Almost 2 in 3 Americans (62%) felt that the Republicans spent too much time criticizing their opponents, compared to 51% who said the same about Democrats. Historically, though, the attitudes about the Republican convention largely track with those from 2016, when 31% said they maintained the right balance, and 58% responded that the GOP spent too much time criticizing, according to a Gallup poll.

Blake, a Black man, was shot seven times in the back by an officer as he tried to enter a vehicle in an incident caught on video. The shooting sparked a new wave of protests around the country against police brutality and racial discrimination. While discussing the situation in Kenosha during a White House news briefing on Monday, Trump said sometimes an officer \"makes a mistake\" or \"chokes\" under pressure. Trump elaborated on that point later Monday during an interview on \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Fox News, during which he said police are \"under siege.\" \"They can do 10,000 great acts, which is what they do, and one bad apple – or a choker, you know, a choker, they choke – shooting the guy in the back many times,\" Trump told host Laura Ingraham. \"I mean, couldn't you have done something different? Couldn't you have wrestled him?\" Trump asked, wondering how the tragedy could have been avoided. \"You know, I mean, in the meantime he might have been going for a weapon and, you know, there's a whole big thing there.\" \"But they choke, just like in a golf tournament, they miss a 3-foot putt,\" Trump said as Ingraham, one his staunchest supporters in the news media, cut him off. \"You're not comparing it to golf, because that's what the media would say,\" Ingraham said. Trump Kenosha visit: President accused of trying to turn racial unrest into election advantage \"No, I'm saying people choke. People choke. And people are bad people. You have both,\" he said. \"You have some bad people and you have – they choke. You could be a police officer for 15 years and, all of a sudden, you're confronted. You've got a quarter of a second to make a decision. If you don't make the decision and you're wrong, you're dead.\" Trump is scheduled to travel to Kenosha on Tuesday to meet with law enforcement officials and survey damage from the demonstrations. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump is looking forward to going to Kenosha to speak directly to its residents and \"unifying the state.\" Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian, both Democrats, have asked Trump not to come, saying it could hurt the community's effort to heal and would require them to redirect resources toward securing his visit. As Ingraham predicted, many expressed shock and outrage at the comparison between the shooting that left Blake paralyzed and a golfer missing a short putt. \"Disgusting. Trump compares police shooting a Black man in the back 7 times to a golfer who misses a 3-foot putt,\" tweeted Jim Murphy who is a deputy director for the Human Rights Campaign's digital team. Many on social media used dark humor to mock the president for his comment. \"I'll never forget my worst round of golf. I was under a lot of pressure, and on the 15th hole, on what should have been an easy putt for birdie, I choked and shot someone seven times in the back,\" tweeted Robert Maguire, research director for the government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"You know things are bad when Laura Ingraham has to save President Trump from saying stupid things,\" said Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.", "output": "left"}
