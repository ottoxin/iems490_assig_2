Their warnings come as the famous ball drop in New York's Times Square and many other big celebrations will be virtual this year. But gatherings at home and other places could accelerate the spread of COVID-19. \"It's very important to avoid large gatherings and small gatherings, and as we approach New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, we cannot let our guard down,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine warned. According to AAA, as many as 84.5 million Americans were expected to travel from December 23 to January 3 to celebrate the holidays and the New Year. \"It would be magical thinking to think we're not going to see a bump after all this travel around the holiday season with Christmas and New Year's,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said. LaPook is among many health officials concerned about large gatherings violating coronavirus protocols. And testing negative for COVID-19 doesn't make gatherings safe, LaPook said. \"The biggest misconception of this pandemic — and there's not even a close second — is that 'I got tested today and therefore I'm safe tomorrow or the next day.' Remember that the incubation period is 2 to 14 days,\" he said. Law enforcement is already tamping down on large gatherings. In Newark, New Jersey, this weekend, two women were arrested for hosting 200 people at a makeshift indoor bar at a warehouse. At the famous La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, customers reported an upcoming New Year's Eve secret indoor party to authorities. On Tuesday, the restaurant responded to backlash, writing that its invitation was misunderstood and that they \"have consistently taken the most drastic steps to ensure guest and employee safety.\" But invitations like one promoting a party in San Francisco are common across the United States. San Francisco police are warning of penalties for those breaking the state's rules. \"We're very concerned,\" Robert Rueca, the department's public information officer, told CBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste. \"The protocol has been to admonish someone or admonish people, giving them a warning at first. Sometimes, there isn't that chance to admonish someone, and we will issue a citation.\"", "output": "left"}

Law enforcement and federal authorities in the US had already been investigating after a health center in the state said an employee admitted to deliberately spoiling 500 doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Aurora medical center, in Grafton, first reported that the doses of the Moderna vaccine had been spoiled on Saturday, saying a staff member had accidentally left them out of refrigeration overnight. On Wednesday, however, it said the doses appeared to have been spoiled deliberately. Police in Grafton, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, said the department, the FBI and the Food and Drug Administration were investigating the case. A pharmacist at the suburban medical center deliberately removed hundreds of coronavirus vaccine doses from refrigeration and left them out overnight – twice, not just once as officials had initially believed, the health system’s chief medical officer said later on Thursday. Employees at the Aurora medical center in Grafton inoculated nearly 60 people with the ruined vaccine, not knowing the doses had been left out too long, rendering their shots less effective or ineffective, Jeff Bahr, the chief medical officer for Aurora Advocate Health, told reporters during a teleconference. The recipients shouldn’t be in any danger, he said, but the system is monitoring their conditions. The pharmacist intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration, Bahr said, but he declined to comment on the individual’s motive, saying the person has been fired and police are investigating. He did not identify the pharmacist and stressed that the facility’s security protocols are sound. “This was a situation involving a bad actor, as opposed to a bad process,” he said. Police said they were notified of the alleged tampering on Wednesday night, but that no other information would be immediately released. They declined to say if any arrests had been made. In a statement late on Wednesday, Aurora said the employee involved “acknowledged that they intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration”. Aurora said it had fired the person in question and referred the matter to the authorities. The statement said nothing about a possible motive for the action. “We continue to believe that vaccination is our way out of the pandemic. We are more than disappointed that this individual’s actions will result in a delay of more than 500 people receiving their vaccine,” the statement said. The tampering will delay inoculation for hundreds of people, Aurora Health officials said, in a state where 3,170 new cases were reported and 40 people died on Wednesday of Covid-19, according to the Washington Post’s coronavirus tracker. Leonard Peace, an FBI spokesman in Milwaukee, would not comment on the bureau’s involvement but said of the episode: “We’re aware of it.” Initiating an internal review on Monday, hospital officials said they were initially “led to believe” the incident was caused by “inadvertent human error”. The vials were removed on Friday and most were discarded on Saturday, with only a few still safe to administer, according to an earlier statement from the health system. Each vial has enough for 10 vaccinations but can sit at room temperature for only 12 hours. Two days later, the employee acknowledged having “intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration”, according to the hospital statement, the Washington Post reported.", "output": "left"}

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first Republican senator to publicly say he will object to the certification of the presidential election results when a joint session of Congress meets in one week to formally certify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory over President Trump. Roughly a dozen Trump supporters in the House – led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama – have said they will challenge the slate of electors from six battleground states where Biden narrowly edged Trump in last month's election. But the challenge of at least one senator is needed for both houses of Congress to debate the objections. GROWING NUMBER OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S VICTORY OVER TRUMP Hawley, a conservative lawmaker and Trump supporter, said in a release issued Wednesday that in his objection he’ll highlight what he said was the failure of some states – most notably Pennsylvania – to follow their own election laws. A number of states – including Pennsylvania – allowed for a greater use of absentee balloting due to serious health concerns over in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,\" the senator highlighted in a statement. Hawley also charged, \"I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.\" He pointed out that \"following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.\" PENCE APPARENTLY DOESN'T BACK LAWMAKER'S PLAN TO OBJECT TO ELECTION RESULTS The president has repeatedly claimed he beat Biden, who topped the president by more than 7 million votes. Trump has charged that widespread voter fraud aided Biden’s victory. Trump has unsuccessfully urged states with GOP governors or Republican controlled legislatures to overturn Biden’s victories in their states. And dozens of legal challenges by the president and his allies have been shot down. Plus, Attorney General William Barr, who has since stepped down, said last month that his Justice Department has not seen fraud on the kind of scale that could flip the election. Trump met at the White House last week for a strategy session with some of the House Republicans who have said they will object to the election certification. Senate GOP leaders are against this effort to challenge Biden's win, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recognizing the former vice president’s victory, and behind closed doors urging Senate Republicans not to contest the election results. But with Hawley joining the small group of House Republicans in objecting, the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 would be dissolved and the House and Senate would then meet separately for two hours to debate a contested state’s electoral vote. US DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF QUESTIONING ELECTION INTEGRITY Each body would then vote whether to accept or reject that state’s slate of electoral votes. Then the House and Senate reconvene in the joint session. The last time this happened (and only the second time in U.S. history) was in January 2005, following President’ George W. Bush’s narrow reelection victory over Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. One Senate Democrat – Sen. Barbara Boxer of California – and one House Democrat – Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones – objected. In 2017, a handful of House Democrats objected to Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but no Senate Democrats joined them. A state’s slate of electoral votes would only tossed if both the House and Senate vote to do so. But with the Democrats controlling the House and most Senate Republicans not expected to back the push to contest the results, it’s extremely unlikely there would be enough votes to reject any state’s certification. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Hawley is the first GOP senator to say he’d object to the certification, Senator-elect Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas could potentially join their colleague from Missouri. Fox News Marisa Schultz and Tyler Olson contributed to this story.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Coronavirus: Cases of new variant appear worldwide Cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK have been confirmed in several European countries as well as Canada and Japan. Infections linked to people who arrived from the UK were reported in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and France. A couple found infected in Ontario, Canada, had no known travel history or high-risk contacts, officials say. Japan is to ban most non-resident foreign nationals from entering the country for a month from Monday. Since reporting infections in five passengers who had all arrived from the UK, the country has confirmed two more cases, one of which is said to have been domestically transmitted. Meanwhile, several EU countries have started to vaccinate people against the virus ahead of a co-ordinated rollout across the whole bloc on Sunday. Health workers in north-east Germany said they were not prepared to wait another day to distribute the newly approved Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They began by immunising elderly residents of a nursing home in Halberstadt. In Hungary, the state news agency said the first recipient of the vaccine was a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital. The authorities in Slovakia also said they had begun vaccinating. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has released a video on Twitter celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it a \"touching moment of unity. Scientists say the new variant of Covid-19 may have been spotted in the UK first because of the strength of the country's surveillance system. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. How far has the new variant spread? Those infected in Canada are a couple from Durham, near Toronto, who are now self-isolating. In Japan, the two new cases are a pilot in his 30s who returned to Japan from London on 16 December and a woman in her 20s, one of his family members with no history of visiting the country, Kyodo News reports. Under the travel suspension coming in on Monday, Japanese nationals and non-Japanese residents who are abroad will be allowed to return, and some travellers such as businesspeople will be allowed to enter from a small number of mainly Asian countries. In Spain, four cases of the new variant were confirmed in Madrid. None of the patients, all of whom travelled from the UK, were seriously ill. Switzerland identified three cases, two of which are known to be British citizens currently in the country. Switzerland is alone in Europe in keeping its ski slopes open to tourism over the Christmas and New Year period, and thousands of tourists from Britain have arrived in the last couple of weeks. In Sweden, the health agency said a traveller there was ill with the strain but had been self-isolating since he returned from the UK. France confirmed its first case of the new variant - a French citizen in the central town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December, the health ministry said. The man, who had been living in the UK, was asymptomatic and currently self-isolating at home, the ministry said. France closed its border with the UK after the new variant was confirmed in Britain but ended its ban for EU citizens on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. Thousands of lorry drivers spent Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent waiting to cross the English Channel. Cases in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Australia were reported earlier. What is the new variant? The new variant first detected in southern England in September is blamed for sharp rises in levels of positive tests in recent weeks in London, south-east England and the east of England About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Three things are coming together that mean the new variant is attracting attention: - It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus - It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important - Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these build a case for a virus that can spread more easily, says the BBC's health and science correspondent, James Gallagher.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "After throwing the bill into doubt earlier this week, President Donald Trump caved Sunday night and signed the coronavirus relief and federal spending measure, averting a government shutdown and ensuring millions of unemployed Americans get some relief going into the new year. It was an act of mercy for millions, after the president suddenly indicated Tuesday night that he wouldn’t support the bill. Trump said he wanted to increase direct stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 ― as well as eliminate a number of foreign aid provisions that were included in his own budget request earlier this year ― but Republicans wouldn’t go along with his call to increase checks, and Trump seemed to realize that holding out on the bill would cause chaos and distress across the country. On top of ending unemployment benefits for more than 10 million people, Trump would have caused a government shutdown, delayed vaccine distribution, and held up stimulus checks for weeks ― if they ever even came. Instead, Trump folded and agreed to the bill that lawmakers and his own administration negotiated. An hour before signing the bill, Trump tweeted from his Mar-a-Lago resort that he had “good news on Covid Relief Bill.” He is vacationing at the Florida resort for the Christmas holiday. Trump’s decision to sign the bill is a major sigh of relief for Republican lawmakers, who were surprised to see the president, who spent months seemingly uninterested in negotiations, suddenly turn on a bill that’s been tediously hashed out for months. Trump released a ranting four-minute video on Twitter Tuesday, where he called the government spending Congress had passed “wasteful” and criticized the COVID-19 provisions as inadequate. He also demanded $2,000 stimulus checks, even though he hadn’t pushed for them in a package his own White House negotiated. The bill, which was largely seen as the only compromise that could get through a deeply divided Congress, passed with veto-proof majorities — 359-53 in the House and 92-6 in the Senate. “The Senate will start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230, and starts an investigation into voter fraud,” Trump said in a statement after signing the bill. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act shields social media companies from being liable for their users’ behavior. But Trump’s sudden turn against the legislation threatened to sink it entirely. Because the congressional session ends on January 3rd, Trump could have waited to veto the bill and seen the measure die then, forcing both chambers to pass the bill again to send it to his desk, at which point he could have waited another 10 days before deciding to either veto it or let it become law without his signature. Such a decision would have caused another government shutdown ― absent a stopgap spending bill ― and withheld aid from tens of millions of struggling Americans who have lost their jobs or have seen reduced income due to the coronavirus pandemic. The federal programs Congress created to help the jobless earlier this year expired on Dec. 26, cutting off much needed financial help to upward of 14 million Americans who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. In fact, because Trump waited to sign the bill until Sunday night, millions won’t receive benefits this week. According to Michele Evermore, an unemployment policy expert with the National Employment Law Project, unemployment recipients will miss out on one week of the extra $300, already bringing the 11 weeks of extra federal unemployment benefits provided by the legislation down to 10. Congress could still try to pass extra stimulus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) already attempted to increase direct payments in the COVID-19 relief bill from $600 to $2,000 — as Trump demanded — on Christmas Eve, but Republicans blocked the attempt. In the end, Trump signed what Congress gave him in the first place. “As President, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child,” Trump said in the statement. “I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,” he continued. “I will send back to Congress a redlined version, item by item, accompanied by the formal rescission request to Congress insisting that those funds be removed from the bill.” Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) released a statement about Trump wanting to “reverse funding his own administration requested and undo the careful bipartisan agreement he has just signed.” “The House Appropriations Committee has jurisdiction over rescissions, and our Democratic Majority will reject any rescissions submitted by President Trump,” said Lowey, who chairs the committee. Pelosi said in a statement Sunday night that the COVID-19 relief package is “a down payment on what is needed to crush the virus.” “We need to ensure robust support for state and local government to distribute and administer a vaccine, keep workers employed and prevent devastating service cuts — and we must do so as soon as possible,” she said. The law will provide $300 a week in unemployment insurance until mid-March, and a $600 direct payment to those making under $75,000. The law also includes $20 billion for vaccine procurement, and $9 billion for vaccine distribution. K-12 schools, colleges and universities will get $82 billion to deal with pandemic. Small businesses get the most funding; the Paycheck Protection Program will get $284 billion more for forgivable loans to businesses, and there’s an additional $20 billion in Economic Injury Disaster Loans, $15 billion for live entertainment venues and movie theaters, and several billion for other Small Business Administration programs. Federal emergency relief has been a crucial part of keeping Americans afloat as the economy has tanked this year. This law would make people’s lives better by dramatically reversing a persistent decline in personal income caused by the CARES Act programs expiring, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a federal spending watchdog group. CFRB estimates the aid in the COVID-19 relief bill would increase income in the first three months of 2021 between 11 and 13% above pre-pandemic levels. Previous studies have shown the federal programs created under the CARES Act kept millions from sinking into poverty over the summer. “While this boost will not last through the second quarter of next year, higher household savings in the first quarter and a robust economic recovery as the weather warms and vaccines are distributed could make a huge difference for the remainder of 2021,” the CRFB said in its analysis. Trump’s penchant for drama threw Washington in a frenzy this week, completely scrambling political alliances and risking the livelihoods of millions. Suddenly Republicans were forced to defy their own president’s calls for an even bigger relief bill and Democrats were given renewed hope that they could renegotiate parts of the proposal more to their liking. But in the end, Democrats got a different kind of political win. By criticizing the bill before ultimately signing it, Trump has stepped all over the GOP’s message that this bill is a major win for his party — and he’s done it just weeks before two high-stakes Senate races in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will decide control of Congress, where Republican incumbents Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue now have to eat their words touting a law that Trump is on record saying he hates. “Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow,” Pelosi said in her statement. “Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need.” Sanjana Karanth contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

Little bottles with hooks for sanitizing on the go! Mary Lopez, a retired forensic accountant from California, is a longtime home-necessities gifting proponent, and her family has been giving pandemic-themed gifts all year. For her daughter's birthday, Lopez assembled a basket of lockdown-survival aids, including Clorox cleaning spray, some money on a gift card, two candy-filled wine glasses and a bottle of wine. Her daughter replicated this basket for her friends for the holidays, adding also toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles. Gifts of sanitation tend to be an add-on to other items people are exchanging this year — a dose of pandemic reality on top of regular gifts. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, categories selling particularly well are electronics, home furnishings and athleisure clothes. On a recent run to Costco just outside Washington, D.C., banking analyst Ritesh Ranjan spotted a 2020 unicorn: a five pack of Clorox wipes. He remembered friends mentioning they had trouble finding them. \"Hopefully it'll remind them of the conversation we have had about it, and hopefully it helps,\" Ranjan said. But later he felt a bit guilty for snatching those wipes that are so rare these days: \"Did [I] steer the product away from someone who would need it much more urgently?\" he pondered. \"After I bought this one, I decided I'm not going to buy any more of these for gifts.\" Kathleen Murray, a teacher from Virginia Beach, Va., also never expected to be gifting cleaning products for the holidays. But she came across some holiday-themed hand sanitizers, with scents like vanilla and Christmas cookies, and couldn't resist. \"It at least cheers you up,\" she said. \"You have to use it regardless. But if it smells like gingerbread, I'd rather use that.\" The sanitizers went into her Advent calendars for family members, as little daily gifts alongside candy, festive face masks and other pandemic essentials. Asked if all these sanitation-themed gifts felt just a little bit sad, she laughed. \"I guess a bit sad,\" Murray said. \"But also like — if you could give anyone a gift, you want to give them safety. I would love to be able to give them all the vaccine, but you obviously can't do that. It's the closest thing to safety that you can give them.\"", "output": "left"}

Wednesday marked the deadline to veto the National Defense Authorization Act before it became law. The president left the White House for his Christmas getaway at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Trump, who insists he is one of the most pro-military presidents in history, pledged to veto the legislation when it did not include the nixing of Section 230, a provision protecting internet companies from being liable for what third parties post on their platforms. \"No one has worked harder, or approved more money for the military, than I have — over $2 trillion,\" Mr. Trump said as he explained his veto to Congress. \"During my four years, with the support of many others, we have almost entirely rebuilt the United States military, which was totally depleted when I took office. Your failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone knowing what we are doing at every step.\" The House and Senate passed the NDAA with veto-proof majorities, but it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will still stand up to the president when the legislation returns to the House. Both the House and Senate need to re-approve the legislation with two-thirds majorities in order to override a presidential veto. The House and Senate will have to return after Christmas to vote. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Thursday that the House would return on Monday to overturn Mr. Trump's veto. The $740 billion bill funds the Pentagon, and includes a 3% raise for troops. Opposition to the president's veto, including from Republicans, was immediate. \"The NDAA has become law every year for 59 years straight because it's absolutely vital to our national security and our troops. This year must not be an exception. Our men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform shouldn't be denied what they need— ever,\" said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act means internet companies, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, aren't generally liable if a user posts something illegal. Mr. Trump and some Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Josh Hawley have railed against social media companies for how they handle conservative content. But the defense spending bill isn't the only legislation up in the air. Mr. Trump has also threatened to refuse to sign the COVID-19 relief package that is expected at his desk soon, insisting it needs to include stimulus checks for $2,000 and other provisions.

The president, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims that he won the presidential election in a \"magnificent landslide\" and attacked the two most powerful Republicans in the U.S. Senate because they've acknowledged that President-elect Biden won the election. Trump's broadsides against his own party, unproven election claims and 11th-hour stimulus demands after essentially being absent through the entire negotiating process continued his pattern of sowing chaos in the waning days of his presidency as he's failed to publicly accept that he will be leaving the White House in less than a month. \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said in his Twitter video. \"I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\" Watch: The year-end funding package, often referred to as an omnibus, was combined with the coronavirus stimulus bill as Congress raced to get out of Washington, D.C., for Christmas. The funding package was previously negotiated in Congress, while lawmakers finally came to an agreement on the coronavirus aid over the weekend. Both would have had to pass anyway, but combining them allowed it to be done in one vote. TRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS Some lawmakers had voiced process objections over the fact the two were combined and derisively termed the monstrous legislation the \"coronabus.\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said it \"should have been divided into well over 20 bills.\" But Trump appeared to confuse the spending package that funds the government and the coronavirus stimulus. \"A few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever,\" Trump said. \"However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.\" Trump added: \"For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity -- it's called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID.\" It's unclear at this point what Congress will do about Trump's demands. Trump did not issue a direct veto threat in his Tuesday video and still could sign the bill if lawmakers and their staffs don't come back -- although it is not clear if they will or not, according to congressional sources. FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS Trump also has the potential, if he simply refuses to sign the \"coronabus\" and Congress doesn't send him anything more, to \"pocket veto\" the legislation. That would force Congress to essentially start the legislative process all over. It would put the government at risk of a shutdown yet again, as it is currently operating on a seven-day interim spending bill. Democrats, meanwhile, immediately seized on Trump's check demand to attack Republicans and demand that the direct stimulus be increased to $2,000 per individual. The House plans on Thursday to try to amend the bill via unanimous consent. \"Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted. \"At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!\" \"I’m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted. \"Let’s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment on what the Senate may do in light of Trump's Monday video. He and other GOP lawmakers touted the stimulus deal as a triumph on Monday and Tuesday before Trump called it a \"disgrace.\" The White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story. PRESIDENT TRUMP GRANTS SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE PARDONS And the pressure on Republicans is not just from a legislative angle in Congress. Trump handed the Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia a cudgel with which to hammer their incumbent Republican opponents. \"Last night Kelly Loeffler and I left Georgia late, got up there just before midnight, we voted on this next round of COVID relief and I'm so proud to be able to bring that relief back to Georgia,\" Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a video posted Tuesday, hours before Trump slammed lawmakers for sending the package to his desk. Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for Jon Ossoff, who is the Democrat challenging Perdue, shared Trump's video with his followers. \"David Perdue is already running ads touting a COVID relief bill he had nothing to do with,\" Moussa said. \"Here’s Donald Trump ripping it apart.\" \"President Trump is as ever, erratic and all over the place, but on this point, he's right. $600 is a joke,\" Ossoff himself added. \"And David Perdue, my opponent, who opposed even the first round of $1,200 checks – imagine that... And now decided he wanted to cut it down to $600 bucks when people can barely feed their families through no fault of their own.\" Many Republicans were already worried that Trump's election fraud claims could depress GOP turnout for Loeffler and Perdue, although Trump has vocally backed the two senators and even traveled to Georgia to campaign for them. The campaigns for Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., did not respond to requests for comment on the Trump video. The Georgia Senate races will decide which party controls the body for the next two years and to what extent Republicans can thwart Biden's agenda. In a separate video Tuesday, Trump continued his false claims that \"we won the election by a landslide, we won it big.\" He repeated a number of claims that have been pushed by fringe allies of his, including lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, whose election-related lawsuits have been uniformly rejected by the courts. Trump concluded, \"We cannot allow a completely fraudulent election to stand.\" Trump's allegations of voter fraud have been putting Republicans in a tight spot, forcing them to choose between supporting the president's unsubstantiated claims or risking his Twitter ire. And no Republicans are immune from it. In the past week, Trump has lambasted the top two Republicans in the Senate for accepting the result of the presidential election -- that Biden won. After McConnell congratulated Biden on his victory, Trump last week said in a tweet that McConnell \"and Republican Senators have to get tougher.\" Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., meanwhile, previously said that \"it's time for everybody to move on\" from the election challenges and to accept Biden's victory. Asked Monday about the prospects for success of a challenge in Congress to Biden's Electoral College victory, which Trump has endorsed, Thune said it will be \"going down like a shot dog.\" That led Trump to declare that Thune's time in the Senate is limited. \"Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, 'Mitch’s boy', should just let it play out,\" Trump said in a tweet Tuesday. \"South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thune's office has not publicly responded to the Trump tweet. Trump will leave office on Jan. 20 when Biden is inaugurated, at least somewhat easing the pressure on the GOP to back his erratic behavior. But he has already hinted that he would run for president in 2024, which could freeze the field of presidential candidates and force Republicans to continue to be accountable to Trump or else risk losing his base. Fox News reported Tuesday that Bill Stepien, Trump's reelection campaign manager, and other top Trump campaign members are setting up a political consulting firm that will likely work with Trump as he continues to wield his influence over the GOP even after he leaves office.

The United States is the first country to greenlight use of Moderna's vaccine, which was developed in part with the National Institutes of Health. Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \"This is another crucial step in the fight against the global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States every day,\" FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said during a media briefing late Friday. Indeed, the news was met with optimism. \"I've never been more hopeful that we will eventually turn the corner on this pandemic,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"I encourage all Americans to get vaccinated when their groups are called, and I look forward to doing so when it is my turn.\" Nearly 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been earmarked for distribution and are expected to be shipped to 3,285 locations across the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, which partially funded the Moderna work. In a statement issued Friday, Moderna said that about 20 million doses of its vaccine will be delivered to the U.S. government by the end of this year. \"The Company expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the U.S.,\" the statement read. Moderna's vaccine has been shown to be safe and highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness, according to documents released Tuesday. The data also suggest that the vaccine may reduce the virus's spread by preventing infections, though more data are needed to fully understand that finding. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, called the finding \"intriguing\" during the Friday briefing, adding that the NIH is considering studying this further. The FDA authorization comes the day after an advisory committee to the agency recommended the vaccine in a near unanimous vote. Of 21 voting members, 20 voted in favor of authorization. One person, Dr. Michael Kurilla, an infectious disease expert with the National Institutes of Health, abstained from voting because he said he felt the question on which the committee voted, \"Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?\" was too broad, and should have been targeted toward people at highest risk for severe Covid-19. Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Last week, the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for those ages 16 and older. Nearly 3 million doses of that vaccine were on target for delivery this week to health care workers and people in long-term care facilities. A second batch of doses has been reserved for the second shot, administered 21 days after the first. Moderna's vaccine is also given in two doses, but 28 days apart. Clinical trials showed the vaccine was 94 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness within two weeks after the second dose. Pfizer's has been shown to be similarly effective. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine does not need to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Rather, the vaccine can be stored at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperature of a standard refrigerator — for up to 30 days, the company said in a statement Wednesday. One potentially thorny issue is the risk of severe allergic reactions. The FDA's Marks said Friday night that the agency was looking into \"roughly five\" allergic reactions linked to the Pfizer vaccine. One of those reactions was reported in a health care worker in Alaska who needed to be hospitalized. While no such reactions were reported during Moderna's clinical trials, the FDA is advising people who have had severe reactions to vaccines in the past to forgo the vaccine at this time, until more information is available. One potential — but as yet unproven — culprit for the allergic reactions is polyethylene glycol, which is present in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Marks said, adding any ideas about what could be leading to allergic reactions remain speculative. No long-term problems have been reported. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.", "output": "left"}

The House and Senate passed a two-day extension of government funding to keep agencies operating until Sunday night. The White House announced just after 10 p.m. ET on Friday that President Donald Trump had signed the bill, ensuring the government would stay open through the weekend. The move ratcheted up pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to finalize a stimulus agreement that they have said for days they are on the cusp of reaching. Now lawmakers will stay in Washington over the weekend as Hill leaders continue to work with many rank-and-file members growing increasingly frustrated and impatient over the lack of information about a major rescue package they have yet to see but expect to be voting on in just a matter of days. Hill leaders have been confronting problems on multiple fronts. There are key outstanding issues that have not been resolved in the talks, including an effort by Republicans to restrict the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority that has sparked intense push back from Democrats. There is also growing frustration among rank-and-file lawmakers who feel they have been left in the dark about the contents of the deal, with at least one Republican threatening to shut down the government unless the situation changes. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri expressed frustration over the process earlier in the day, saying, “It’s beginning to reach the point of absurdity.” Tensions continued to boil over on the House floor Friday afternoon among members who are shut out of the talks, according to members in both parties. “What the hell is going on?” one Democrat said, summing up the frustration on the floor. A Republican House member added: “We are hearing nothing – and it’s outrageous.” To pull off passage of a short-term funding bill just hours before midnight will require bipartisan cooperation and all 100 senators to agree to schedule a vote. Later on Friday, Hawley, who has been pushing for $1,200 stimulus checks, said that he would not object to a stop-gap measure in the Senate. “I have been assured by Senate GOP leadership that #COVID direct assistance to working people IS in the #covid relief bill under negotiation & will remain. And on that basis, I will consent to a brief continuing resolution to allow negotiations to conclude,” he tweeted. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is also pushing for $1,200 checks, has been non-committal on whether he would give consent to keep the government open for two more days, saying, “We are thinking about it.” Risks of a potential shutdown If a lapse in government funding occurs, it would begin over the weekend and could be so brief that it would have virtually no impact on government operations. But there would still be major risks involved – especially if they’re unable to resolve their impasse, causing a protracted shutdown in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, raging economic crisis and a high-stakes vaccine rollout. Moreover, even a brief shutdown would almost certainly inflame partisan tensions that could make efforts to finish negotiations over a stimulus package even more complicated. A partisan blame game over a shutdown could also be damaging for both parties with little time left before the consequential Georgia Senate runoff races take place in January that will determine control of the chamber in the new Congress. Key issues outstanding to a deal The holdup in finalizing a deal comes as a result of a slate of issues that have yet to be resolved. “It’s a little bit of whack-a-mole, you know, whack it here and something else pops up,” said Thune. “There’s a lot of interaction between the moving parts of all this, and getting it all lined up at the same time is proving to be pretty hard.” The relief deal, which could have a price tag of close to $900 billion, is expected to include money for vaccine distribution and schools, jobless benefits of $300 per week, roughly $330 billion for small business loans, and a new round of stimulus checks, which could be set at around $600 per individual under a certain income threshold – half the amount given under the March stimulus law. The leadership is facing pressure from the right and left to tweak the deal before it’s unveiled. Democrats contend that “an agreement was in sight” until Republicans pushed a provision by Sen. Pat Toomey to rein in the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority, according to a senior Democratic aide. Democrats argue it’s intended to constrain the Biden administration’s efforts to respond to the crisis. Toomey denies that he’s trying to constrain the Biden administration and argues these programs were meant to wind down at year’s end. Other outstanding issues include whether there should be further restrictions on who should be eligible for the one-time checks and whether and how long to extend the eviction moratorium, as some Republicans argue that providing rental assistance could be sufficient. Democrats disagree. The leadership has also continued to negotiate how Federal Emergency Management Agency money for states and cities would be structured, according to sources, something Democrats are pushing but Republicans are resisting. For now, lawmakers are bracing for the possibility that a lapse in government funding may trigger a midnight shutdown. “There may be a partial lapse. It’s clear we’re here for the weekend,” Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said on Thursday. “It seems to me that the issues that remain unresolved are bridgeable. But the question is how long does that take.” This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, withdrew his objection to the bill after warning he would not agree to a final government funding bill until it is paired with the coronavirus bill. “Let us get this package passed,” Sanders said. “Let us make certain we have direct payments to families.” Sen.

Earlier, CNN reported that Pence was “likely” to receive the vaccine by Friday, according to two sources. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Pence will receive the vaccine on air to build “vaccine confidence” among Americans, Axios reported. Various polls show that 20% to 40% of Americans won’t commit to getting the vaccine, though those numbers have been on the rise in recent months. Pence is reportedly receiving the vaccine after nine months of standing by President Donald Trump and his pandemic response, which has largely consisted of downplaying the severity of the disease, dismissing the need for basic safety measures, pushing dangerous treatment ideas and refusing to issue a comprehensive federal response. Pence, too, has pushed misleading talking points about the disease while leading the White House’s coronavirus task force. On a call with governors in June, he downplayed increases in COVID-19 diagnoses in some regions as simply “intermittent” spikes and claimed higher figures were merely a result of increased testing.

Now, he’s making history again as the first openly gay man to be nominated to a Cabinet role, with President-elect Joe Biden tapping Buttigieg this week as his pick for U.S. Transportation secretary. As Buttigieg accepted the nomination Wednesday afternoon, he recalled how as a 17 year old in Indiana, he watched the experience of James Hormel, who President Bill Clinton nominated as ambassador to Luxembourg in 1998 -- an appointment Senate Republicans balked at for two years in protest. “I can remember watching the news… (and) seeing a story about an appointee of President Clinton named to be an ambassador attacked and denied a vote in the Senate because he was gay – ultimately able to serve only by a recess appointment,” he said. “And I learned something about some of the limits that exist in this country when it comes to who is allowed to belong. But just as important, I saw how those limits could be challenged.\" Two decades later, he said, he thought about whether other teens might be watching now, wondering whether and where they belonged in the world – “or even in their own family. And I’m thinking about the message that today’s announcement is sending to them.” Buttigieg, who ran against Biden for president before dropping out of the race and endorsing him, often campaigned to great enthusiasm with his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, by his side. In a statement issued Tuesday, Biden said he hoped Buttigieg would lead “with focus, decency and a bold vision. He will bring people together to get big things done.” Buttigieg, 38, would also be the first millennial Cabinet member, representing a demographic more likely to identify as LGBTQ compared with older Americans. About a fifth of millennials identify as LGBTQ, compared with 7% of Boomers, according to a 2017 GLAAD survey. “This will be a historic milestone for LGBTQ visibility,” said GLAAD president/CEO Sarah Kate Ellis in a statement posted on Twitter, noting that should the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor be confirmed by the Senate, he would become the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in U.S. history. “Pete’s experience and skills as a leader, manager and brilliant communicator, combined with his heartland roots and his unqualified commitment to diversity and equality, will improve the lives of all Americans,” Ellis said. Kevin Jennings, CEO of Lambda Legal, called Buttigieg’s nomination a landmark accomplishment. “If you’re not at the table, you’re probably on the menu,” Jennings said in an interview, noting that gay Americans died by the tens of thousands without high-level representation during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. “Now we have someone at the table to make sure our community does not get ignored, and who literally is there to make sure the trains run on time.” Buttigieg's ascension in U.S. politics comes after complaints by LGBTQ activists that civil rights have eroded under the Trump administration, including the Department of Defense prohibiting trans individuals from military service; the Department of Education rolling back protections for LGBTQ students; and the Department of Labor allowing contractors to ignore federal anti-discrimination laws if at odds with their religious beliefs. LGBTQ leaders also fear the number of conservative judges appointed by Trump could reverse the community’s civil-rights gains and health care protections. Erin Uritus, CEO of Out & Equal, a nonprofit dedicated to workplace equality, said Buttigieg “embodies the best in public service.” “Every workplace deserves our leadership,” Uritus tweeted Tuesday afternoon. “This administration is demonstrating that visibility and expertise matter. For the first time ever, LGBTQ Americans can see a Cabinet-level position filled by an open member of the community.” Meanwhile, the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization representing LGBT conservatives, were quick to note that Buttigieg would not be the first openly gay man to serve in a Cabinet-level role. “Facts are facts,” the group tweeted in pointing out that that distinction fell to Richard Grenell, who served as both an ambassador and acting director of national intelligence under President Donald Trump. However, Grenell was not formally confirmed by the Senate. Buttigieg, deployed to Afghanistan as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve, came out as gay while serving as South Bend mayor in 2015, saying he had felt for years that he could be out or in politics, but not both. His nomination as Transportation secretary, said LGBTQ Victory Institute president Annise Parker, “is a new milestone in a decades-long effort to ensure LGBTQ people are represented throughout our government – and its impact will reverberate well beyond the department he will lead.\" In a statement issued Tuesday, Parker added that the appointment would fulfill one of her group’s goals for the incoming administration, which in addition to nominating an openly LGBTQ person as a Cabinet member include nominating an LGBTQ person to the U.S. Supreme Court. Tony Vedda, president and CEO of the North Texas LGBT Chamber of Commerce, said he hoped Buttigieg is appreciated as much for the skills and perspective he brings to the Cabinet role as for his status as a gay man, though he acknowledged that Buttigieg’s visibility could help break down stereotypes. “He’s a smart guy, and certainly the youngest person in the Cabinet, so he’s bringing some new ideas,” Vedda said. “It’s a very positive thing for the community and lets people see that we are like the rest of society, complete individuals, and being LGBT is just part of who we are.\" “Will his appointment change hearts and minds? It could. But if we’ve learned one thing from the outgoing administration, it’s that prejudice is alive and well in this country. So for all the positive gains that the LGBT community has made over the last 10 years, there really is a need for vigilance and for us to continue to have to prove ourselves.” Rick Chavez Zbur, executive director of Equality California, the state’s largest statewide LGBTQ+ civil rights organization and among the first such groups to support Buttigieg’s presidential campaign, said Buttigieg’s nomination filled him with hope and pride. “I want LGBTQ+ young people across the country to see Secretary Buttigieg and know that the sky is the limit,” Zbur said in a statement. Recounting how others throughout history – such as U.S. Army astronomer Frank Kameny – had been fired in decades past for their sexual orientation or gender identity, Zbur praised Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris for “shutting the door forever on that painful legacy and sending a clear message to LGBTQ+ people everywhere that we deserve a seat at every table and belong in every hall of power. “Today, more than ever,” Zbur said, “we are proud to be on Team Pete.” The Rev. Neil Thomas of Dallas’ Cathedral of Hope, a historically and predominately LGBT congregation in Dallas, recalled how Buttigieg visited the church early last year to listen to church members’ concerns as he ran for president. Thomas praised Buttigieg for staying for nearly two hours, which was twice the scheduled time. “I am confident – and delighted – that Americans will now get to experience the leadership, intelligence, passion and inclusion of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in our collective daily life that we in Dallas experienced for two amazing hours in February 2019,” Thomas said. Jennings, of Lambda Legal, said that while Buttigieg’s nomination is significant, it doesn’t mean the community can be complacent. “We’re not one and done,” Jennings said. “That’s tokenism, and we shouldn’t look to one person to represent an entire community. That’s unfair to them, and too large a task for anyone.”", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Imagine a popular social network that takes privacy super seriously. By default, your posts are visible only to people in your real-life community. Not only does the company not use tracking cookies, but it promises it never will. It even announces that future changes to the privacy policy will be put to a vote by users before implementation. It’s hard to imagine now, but such a social network once existed. It was called Facebook. The company’s journey from privacy-focused startup to mass surveillance platform is at the heart of the long-awaited antitrust case filed today by a group of 46 states, along with the District of Columbia and Guam. The bipartisan coalition, led by New York State Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that Facebook achieved its dominance through a years-long strategy of anticompetitive tactics, including its acquisitions of budding rivals like Instagram and WhatsApp. As it built up that dominant position, the suit argues, it began offering users a worse and worse privacy experience. The Federal Trade Commission also filed suit against Facebook today. The two cases, which were filed in the District of Columbia federal district court and will likely be combined into one, come after more than a year of coordinated investigation into the company. In a statement, Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead referred to the allegations in the legal complaints as “revisionist history,” noting that the FTC approved the Instagram and WhatsApp mergers at the time. That may be, but there isn’t any “no backsies” rule in antitrust. The FTC of 2020 appears to have a different view of online competition than it did six years ago. The agency is seeking bold remedies, including forcing Facebook to divest itself of Instagram and WhatsApp, which it acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Together, the lawsuits confront a question that has long shadowed the push for antitrust enforcement against tech platforms: How do you prove people are being harmed by a product that’s offered for free? Judging by the complaint filed by the states, which is more thorough than the FTC’s, the answer will hinge on privacy. At first blush, privacy and antitrust might seem like separate issues—two different chapters in a textbook about big tech. But the decline in Facebook’s privacy protections plays a central role in the states’ case. Antitrust is a complicated field built on a simple premise: When a company doesn’t face real competition, it will be free to do bad things. With Facebook, the lack of competition is easy to prove. The company is by far the biggest social network in the US and, thanks to Instagram and WhatsApp, owns two of the other biggest. Facebook itself boasted in 2011 that “Facebook is now 95% of all social media.” (Today, Facebook insists that it faces robust competition from everything else that a person could devote their attention to. That is generally not how markets are defined for antitrust purposes, however.) The bigger hurdle for antitrust enforcement is proving the “bad things” part—showing not only that Facebook built up a monopoly, but that its monopoly has been harmful. Since the 1970s, antitrust law has revolved around the so-called consumer welfare standard, under which a monopoly is deemed illegal only if it hurts consumers. In practice, that turns most antitrust cases into arguments over whether a given merger will or won’t lead to a price increase. The consumer welfare standard is controversial—the House antitrust subcommittee has suggested scrapping it—but for now remains the law of the land. That poses a special challenge for a case against a company like Facebook that doesn’t charge users any money. Last year saw a conceptual breakthrough on that front. In a paper titled “The Antitrust Case Against Facebook,” the legal scholar Dina Srinivasan argued that Facebook’s takeover of the social networking market has inflicted a very specific harm on consumers: It has forced them to accept ever worse privacy settings. Facebook, Srinivasan pointed out, began its existence in 2004 by differentiating itself on privacy. Unlike then-dominant MySpace, for example, where profiles were visible to anyone by default, Facebook profiles could be seen only by your friends or people at the same school, verified by a .edu email address. “We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user,” vowed an early privacy policy. As the company grew, Srinivasan argued, Facebook tried to backslide on its privacy commitments, but it faced discipline from a market that it still hadn’t cornered. In 2007, it rolled out Beacon, a product that allowed it to track user activity even when they were off the site. Facing fierce backlash—Beacon publicly reported your purchase habits on friends’ NewsFeeds—the company discontinued Beacon within the year. Zuckerberg called it a “mistake.” After rivals like MySpace exited the stage, however, Facebook had less to fear. Today, its “pixel” tracks users all around the internet, just as Beacon did (but without the ill-considered NewsFeed posts). According to Srinivasan, this is just one of many ways in which Facebook rolled back privacy protections once it sensed users couldn’t take their business elsewhere. Srinivasan’s theory provided an elegant theoretical solution to the consumer harm puzzle but left open some empirical questions: Did Facebook actually compete for users by offering better privacy protections? And did it really renege on those commitments later on simply because the company’s leaders thought they could get away with it? The case filed by the state attorneys general provides new evidence suggesting that the answer to both questions is yes. It cites an internal report from 2008 in which the company identifies strong privacy controls as one of four pillars of “Facebook Secret Sauce.” The report observed, “Users will share more information if given more control over who they are sharing with and how they share.” The most revealing insight comes from the summer of 2011, when the company was gearing up to fend off the threat of Google’s rival platform, Google+. The complaint quotes an email in which Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg wrote, “For the first time, we have real competition and consumers have real choice … we will have to be better to win.” At the time, Facebook had been planning to remove users’ ability to untag themselves in photos. One unnamed executive suggested pumping the brakes. “If ever there was a time to AVOID controversy, it would be when the world is comparing our offerings to G+,” they wrote. Better, they suggested, to save such changes “until the direct competitive comparisons begin to die down.” This is close to a smoking gun: evidence that, as Srinivasan hypothesized, Facebook preserves user privacy when it fears competition and degrades privacy when it doesn’t. The states and FTC make a number of other claims about the harm caused by Facebook’s monopolistic practices, but they are relatively vague. Sure, Facebook’s tendency to gobble up potential competitors or cut them off from its developer tools has probably reduced the level of innovation in the field, but who’s to say what social networking would look like in the counterfactual scenario? The privacy theory, by contrast, has the virtue of being concrete: Facebook really did backslide on privacy commitments as it grew more dominant, and that appears not to have been coincidental. That isn’t to say the government will therefore glide through litigation; antitrust law remains stacked in favor of big business, and the federal judiciary is full of judges who were indoctrinated into a narrow consumer welfare model. But the privacy argument will at least get the enforcers’ foot in the door. Facebook may not charge users a fee, but that doesn’t mean users haven’t been paying a price. “Part of an antitrust case is to show anticompetitive harms, and because this is a market where users aren’t paying for the product, diminished quality is a really important measure of anticompetitive harm,” said Charlotte Slaiman, a former FTC lawyer and the director of competition policy at Public Knowledge, a DC think tank. Breaking up Facebook could help spur renewed competition for privacy-focused users. Indeed, Facebook had to commit to preserving user privacy as a condition of its WhatsApp acquisition; WhatsApp’s founder later quit after Facebook broke its promise. But Slaiman stressed that other remedies could be even more important. Mandating interoperability, for example, would make it easier for new entrants to attract users. “We really want Facebook to have to compete based on the quality of their product,” she said. Facebook insists that that is what it has been doing all along. “People and small businesses don’t choose to use Facebook’s free services and advertising because they have to; they use them because our apps and services deliver the most value,” said Newstead.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "There’s not much suspense going into Thursday’s meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisers, who are discussing emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine. The EUA is widely expected and has been telegraphed with unusual frankness from the top of the FDA on down. “Our team has done their initial analysis, and we do feel that preliminarily that the success criteria have been met,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn told CNN Tuesday. But the FDA has promised to listen to the advice of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, made up of independent vaccine experts, infectious disease specialists, industry representatives and a consumer representative – 17 regular members and 13 temporary voting members. The meeting begins at 9 a.m. Thursday, and a committee vote could come in the afternoon. The only real questions will be about whether the advisers recommend restrictions to the EUA – perhaps leaving children off the lIst for now, for example. They’ll also discuss how to conduct the post-EUA safety surveillance and whether to offer the shot to clinical trial volunteers who got placebo doses. Unprecedented speed for vaccines The US federal government is supporting the development of seven coronavirus vaccines – four of them in large Phase 3 clinical trials. Two, made by Pfizer and Moderna, have now applied for EUAs. All have been developed with unprecedented speed. The virus known as SARS-CoV-2 was only identified in January but just weeks after it was isolated, the Chinese government shared its genetic sequence and that was enough to get work started on vaccines. Companies, academic researchers and the federal government had been working to develop so-called platforms that could be used to quickly turn around new vaccines. The first two to the finish line, Pfizer’s and Moderna’s, use a plug-and-play technology involving genetic material known as messenger RNA. The approach had already been tried out against infectious diseases such as Zika and against cancer as well, so researchers were confident it was safe. It is also far faster than old-fashioned vaccine development techniques such as, for instance, influenza vaccines, which require samples of the actual virus which must be grown in specially chosen chicken eggs, purified and made into a vaccine – an uncertain and slow process. The mRNA vaccines need just a short stretch of genetic code and employ the human body itself to make its own vaccine. Tests in tens of thousands of volunteers starting in the summer showed it elicited an immune response and appeared to do so safely. “We’ve shortened vaccine timelines here without compromising vaccine safety and efficacy,” Dr. Peter Marks, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which approves vaccines, told an American Medical Association webinar. “The fact that we have so many cases of Covid-19 right now, it’s so unfortunate for us as a country. The only upside to it is when you are doing a clinical trial with an endpoint that’s a clinical infectious disease endpoint, it’s been easy to get to those endpoints because there’s just so many cases,” Marks added. “By August to October of this year it became clearer to us that the first vaccines that came through would indeed likely be granted emergency use authorization because of the incredibly pressing nature of this crisis.” Getting ‘down and dirty’ with vaccine data Pfizer’s vaccine does have what researchers have described as breathtaking efficacy. The company released its first data in media releases, but turned over tens of thousands of pages of it data to the FDA for closer study. Drug companies usually write up summaries of their findings for regulators, but the FDA also asks for all of the primary source material – the charts, even each volunteer’s individual record. Marks said staffers have studied that. “We are the ones that actually don’t just look at the companies’ tables. We actually get down and dirty and we look at the actual adverse event reports, the bad spelling errors that are made by physicians sometimes, et cetera,” Marks said. “They had 95% effectiveness across a wide range of individuals,” he told the AMA. The FDA published its summary and Pfizer’s summary on the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee website Tuesday, and the 95% efficacy claims hold up. “Vaccine efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after Dose 2 was 94.6%, with 9 and 169 cases in the BNT162b2 (the vaccine’s experimental name) and placebo groups respectively,” the FDA review document reads. In other words, nine people who got the vaccine developed coronavirus infections with symptoms after the second shot, while 169 people who got placebo shots became infected. The committee will run through all this data, but members will have read it all before Thursday’s meeting, which will be livestreamed on YouTube, Twitter and the FDA’s website. How the meeting unfolds Staff at the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review will run down the FDA’s study of Pfizer’s data. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who heads the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, will review the CDC’s plans for safety monitoring and other CDC officials will update on the pandemic itself and plans for distributing the vaccine. Stanford University’s Dr. Steven Goodman will talk about what it means for clinical trials going forward if a vaccine is approved. He’ll address the question of asking people to forgo getting a vaccine known to be protective in order to test an unproven one. Other possible questions are whether to include pregnant women and children in an EUA. “At this point I would say, we may not have the data we need to actually be able to advise pregnant women, and we may need additional study,” Hahn said. The committee members will almost certainly discuss allergy warnings out of Britain’s vaccination campaign, as well. And the National Vaccine Advisory Committee asked the FDA to leave children out of an EUA. “The NVAC warns against issuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for COVID-19 vaccines in children, considering that children typically experience generally mild disease, except for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition that causes inflammation and various symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, tiredness, and bloodshot eyes,” the group said last week. Pfizer will also present its data. Then the committee votes whether to recommend authorization. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. But that doesn’t mean the vaccine will be authorized immediately. The decision comes from the FDA, which typically follows the advisory committee’s recommendation. “One question that will come up is how fast will we see a vaccine authorized after that,” FDA’s Marks told the AMA. “It will depend on the discussion at the advisory committee but we are hoping that within about a week afterwards we will see an authorization if everything goes well for each of those,” Marks said. It could come even sooner. In anticipation of an EUA, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has scheduled emergency meetings for Friday and Sunday. This committee – which is separate from FDA’s advisory committee – will recommend whether the CDC should offer the vaccine to the American public. Once the CDC accepts that recommendation, healthcare workers may start giving people their fisrt doses of Pfizer vaccine. The VRPBAC is scheduled to do it all over again next week, with a meeting December 17 to discuss Moderna’s EUA application.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The Trump campaign is falsely claiming that surveillance camera footage captured election workers in Georgia adding thousands of illegal ballots that were brought into an Atlanta facility in suspicious “suitcases” on election night. The campaign presented the video to Georgia state lawmakers on Dec. 3. President Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, wrote on Twitter the same day: “The video tape doesn’t lie. Fulton County Democrats stole the election. It’s now beyond doubt.” Trump himself later amplified the claim at a rally in Georgia on Dec. 5. But state officials told us that the full video shows the supposed “suitcases” were actually standard containers used to secure ballots, and that the ballots in question were opened and prepared for counting earlier in the night in full view of observers. They said the campaign presented limited, selective parts of the footage. That’s based on their review of the day’s video footage in full. Also, even though observers from the parties and press left the room before vote counting resumed, officials said, a state election board monitor and investigator from the secretary of state’s office both returned to watch the counting until its completion. Left unclear, though, are the exact facts surrounding a purported “announcement” to workers in the room that Republican observers claim prompted them to leave, as we’ll explain. No ‘Suitcases’ in Video The video in question — which has been widely shared across social media — was presented to Georgia state legislators during the Dec. 3 hearing by a lawyer named Jacki Pick, who said she was volunteering for Trump’s legal team. Pick is listed as a lawyer by the State Bar of Texas, but she appears to work primarily as a conservative podcast host. She and her husband, Doug Deason, are major Republican donors. Pick said Trump’s legal team received the video the night before and that it shows observers and the press leaving a room at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, which was used to count absentee and military ballots, shortly before 11 p.m. She claimed that, according to witnesses, a woman had told the observers and press that “we’re going to stop counting, everyone go home.” She pointed out that many of the elections workers had left for the night in the video, but four workers are seen in the video staying behind to continue counting. “Once everyone is gone, coast is clear, they are going to pull ballots out from underneath a table – watch this table,” she said at the hearing. “I saw four suitcases come out from underneath the table.” The video shows the counting continued until nearly 1 a.m., she said. But the supposed “suitcases” were typical ballot containers used to secure ballots, Georgia’s Deputy Secretary of State Jordan Fuchs told us in a phone interview. Likewise, Matthew Mashburn, the state Senate’s appointee to the state election board, told us the video showed “standard secure containers that are ubiquitous in tabulation in Georgia.” And Gabriel Sterling, the state’s voting system implementation manager, said that the full video showed that the containers were carrying ballots that were opened and processed earlier in the night. They weren’t suspicious ballots brought surreptitiously into the building, or ballots that were opened in secret. “They were put in there about an hour earlier,” Sterling, a Republican, said by phone. He said of the Trump campaign: “They watched the same video tape.” Sterling also said he saw no anomalies in the vote data that suggested any kind of mass voter fraud, as has been alleged. “These are just regular elections workers” doing their job, he said. While state law allows for observers to watch the vote counting, Sterling said, it was not illegal for the vote counting to resume when the observers left. He said his office was working on making the video footage from the arena public so that voters could see the footage with more context. Observers’ Departure What is clear from our interviews with state officials is that, at some point, the elections workers did evidently plan to stop counting votes. Fulton County Elections Director Rick Barron also made that clear during a special, virtual public meeting on Dec. 4. He said that “certain staff that were on the cutting stations, that were on the flattening stations, that were extracting from the inner envelopes, those staff left as work completed.” “I found out sometime, I think a little after 10:30 [p.m.], that they were gonna cease operations and I told them not to do that,” he said. He added that at “about 11:15 [p.m.], they were fully scanning again.” Pick claimed that witnesses said that a woman came “out to announce, ‘we’re going to stop counting, everyone go home,'” saying the Republican observers were “forced to leave.” But Barron said that “no announcement was ever made to leave, for anyone to leave.” Affidavits from two Republican field organizers referenced by Pick do not claim that they or the media were ever directly told or forced to leave. Instead, the observers say that they left after a woman — who they believed was a supervisor — “yelled” to workers in the room to cease operations and return the next day. The affidavits say that much of the room, except for a few employees, had cleared out. “We have launched an investigation into why the monitors from the political parties left before scanning ended,” the secretary of state’s office said in a statement. “While it was their right to leave early, we want to make certain they were not misled into thinking scanning had stopped for the night when it had not. Nothing we have learned from the independent monitor or our investigation have suggested any improper ballots were scanned.” Sterling said in our Dec. 4 interview with him that it did not appear there was any official announcement made to the observers or press, but there’s no audio to prove that one way or another. On Dec. 5, Frances Watson, the chief investigator for the secretary of state’s office, said in an affidavit that after reviewing the video and conducting interviews, her investigators found “that observers and media were not asked to leave” but “simply left” after they saw workers, whose job was to open the ballots, leave. She said the investigation remains open. Also, there’s no evidence that a “water main break” inside the arena earlier that day had anything to do with the observers and press leaving, as some have claimed. One of Trump’s sons, Eric Trump, wrote on Facebook that “Republican observers were cleared out of State Farm Arena due to a ‘water main break’, but 4 people stayed behind, rolled out suitcases of ballots, & continue to count ballots in private from around 1030PM until 1AM.” But the water leak occurred at 6:07 a.m. on Election Day, according to the arena, and it was fixed within two hours — meaning it occurred long before the episode in question. Debunked Ballot Figures During the legislative hearing, Pick maintained that the votes counted in the room after observers left could have been enough to change the presidential election results in Georgia. Pick theorized that the machines in the room could have totaled “18,000 ballots.” (Biden won the state by less than 12,000 votes.) But that’s wrong, according to the state election board monitor who was in the room as they counted. The monitor — who agreed to be interviewed on the condition of not being named due to death threats faced by election workers — told us he was in the room until about 8:15 p.m., when he left, and returned at 11:52 p.m. Fuchs, the deputy secretary of state, told us the monitor was not required to be there at all times, but she instructed him to return after hearing from news outlets that the county was going to cease counting for the night. The monitor arrived at 11:52 p.m. — after the observers left shortly before 11 p.m. — and stayed until the counting ceased at 12:43 a.m. Between 8:15 p.m. and 12:43 a.m., the change in total ballots went from 89,381 ballots to 99,133 ballots — so a difference of 9,752 votes — he said. And, again, that’s over the course of more than four hours, not just the time after observers and media left. The footage is not the first to spark claims of fraud in Georgia. We also wrote about a video showing an election worker conducting an ordinary part of the recount process in Gwinnett County that prompted false claims. The videos have been part of a surge of falsehoods aimed at undermining the results of the 2020 election, as we’ve reported. Saranac Hale Spencer contributed to this report. Update, Dec. 7: We made updates to this story to reflect new information — including the affidavits from the Republican field organizers and statements from the chief investigator for the secretary of state’s office — pertaining to why the observers and media left the room in State Farm Arena. Update, Aug. 1, 2023: On June 20, the Georgia secretary of state’s office released an investigative report concluding that there was “no evidence” of any fraud regarding the claim that “suitcases” of illegal ballots were counted on election night. Investigators from the FBI, Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the secretary of state’s office interviewed Fulton County election workers and reviewed “the entire unedited security video footage of the events in question” in response to a complaint referred by a state senator and specifically naming two election night workers in the video, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss. “There was no evidence of any type of fraud as alleged. … All allegations made against Freeman and Moss were unsubstantiated and found to have no merit,” the report, dated March 7, concluded. In congressional testimony, the two women described how they had been harassed and received death threats after members of the Trump campaign and others pushed false claims that they had engaged in voter fraud. Freeman and Moss filed a defamation suit against One America News Network and Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. OANN settled the suit in May. A July 25 court filing by Giuliani said he “does not contest” that statements he made about the women were false, but he argues the statements were “constitutionally protected” speech. A political adviser to Giuliani told news organizations that Giuliani “did not acknowledge that the statements were false but did not contest it in order to move on to the portion of the case that will permit a motion to dismiss.” Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "President-elect Joe Biden on Monday announced he’s nominating California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to lead the next administration’s Department of Health and Human Services, a surprise to many who believed the former Democratic congressman would be chosen to head the Justice Department. The selection of Becerra — first reported by The New York Times and CNN on Sunday — is a victory for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which he used to lead. If confirmed, Becerra will be the first Latino to hold the position of HHS secretary. Biden on Monday also announced his picks for several other key roles on his health team, including bringing back Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, nominating Dr. Rochelle Walensky to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and tapping Dr. Anthony Fauci to be his chief medical adviser on COVID-19. “This trusted and accomplished team of leaders will bring the highest level of integrity, scientific rigor, and crisis-management experience to one of the toughest challenges America has ever faced — getting the pandemic under control so that the American people can get back to work, back to their lives, and back to their loved ones,” Biden said in a statement. Latinx lawmakers had been pressing Biden to further diversify his Cabinet and include more Latinx representation. Biden has picked Cuban American lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to run the Department of Homeland Security. “Everybody’s eager to see a Cabinet that reflects America,” Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas) said in an interview with HuffPost last week. “It would be a huge missed opportunity and disappointment if President Biden failed us in that regard.” The Congressional Hispanic Caucus called on Biden last week to choose New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to lead HHS, saying the former state health secretary and only Latina governor “has the vision and drive to see through large projects and effectively lead large organizations.” But that possibility fizzled Wednesday after a source close to the transition team told reporters that Lujan Grisham was no longer a front-runner for health secretary and had turned down an offer to lead Biden’s Interior Department. Sen.-elect Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) confronted incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain and other senior Biden officials for their treatment of Lujan Grisham in a call between transition leaders and caucus members on Thursday. Klain apologized for the leaks from the transition about the New Mexico governor, according to a Democrat with knowledge of the call. Dozens of caucus members sent a letter to Biden on Wednesday arguing for the president-elect to pick either Becerra or Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez to be the U.S. attorney general. Becerra created a name for himself mainly on issues of criminal justice and immigration, which would have made him an unsurprising choice for the Justice Department. But the California attorney general also has a record on health care, most recently acting as the leading Democratic defender of the Affordable Care Act against the latest lawsuit by Republican attorneys general. In addition, he has helped lead his party’s charge for women’s health and defended LGBTQ access to health care by fighting the Trump administration’s “conscience rule,” which allowed health providers to refuse treatment to patients for their own moral or religious reasons. “I’m not sure you could find anyone who has been a stronger defender of the ACA, access to reproductive health care and immigrant rights during the last four years,” Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. As California attorney general, Becerra has also aggressively cracked down on mergers and consolidations in health care as a way to push companies to compete on prices. In 2018, he joined an antitrust lawsuit against Sutter Health accusing the company of using its market power to drive up health care costs in Northern California. He secured a $575 million settlement from Sutter at the end of 2019. Becerra also sought and supported California legislation that would have given the state’s attorney general more power to review mergers involving for-profit health care providers. That legislation did not pass, but reformers have been hoping to try again next year. “Becerra was a health care champion in Congress and then he was very active as attorney general of California in using the tools of that office to protect people’s health care ― and deal with issues of cost, quality and equity,” Anthony Wright, executive director of California’s statewide consumer advocacy group Health Access, told HuffPost. “It went well beyond just checking the boxes of what he had to do,” Wright added. “He was very aggressive about it.” Should Becerra become secretary of HHS, he will lead a department that continues to be especially critical during a pandemic that’s already killed more than 280,000 people in the country ― particularly Black and brown people. Becerra served 12 terms in Congress, representing part of Los Angeles before becoming California’s first Latino attorney general in 2017. As a congressman, he was the first Latino to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee and also led the House Democratic Caucus. He vigorously advocated for the Latinx community and worked to reform the immigration system, a mission he continued as state attorney general. “He’s not a health policy wonk, but most HHS secretaries aren’t and don’t need to be,” Levitt said. “He’s a seasoned political hand and shown an ability to speak to the public about complex health issues.” Jonathan Cohn and Hayley Miller contributed reporting.", "output": "left"}

Biden, during an interview with CNN, said he will ask Americans to mask up, but only for a limited period. \"The first day I'm inaugurated I'm going to ask the public for 100 days to mask,\" Biden said. \"Just 100, not forever -- 100 days.\" \"I think we'll see a significant reduction that occurs with vaccinations and masking to drive down the numbers considerably.\" Biden's comments come a day after the U.S. recorded a new high in coronavirus-related fatalities on Wednesday at 2,804, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS BY STATE: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW The nation – which has logged more than 14 million cases and more than 275,000 deaths since the pandemic began – also recorded 200,070 new daily COVID-19 illnesses, though it did not surpass a previous daily case record set Nov. 27 of 205,557. The record daily death toll coincides with news of a record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients, topping 100,000 on Tuesday. The grim milestone comes as health officials warned of surges tied to holiday travel and lockdown fatigue. Biden's comments also come as he urges lawmakers on Capitol Hill to get behind a bipartisan COVID-19 relief effort after a monthslong logjam to deliver much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York on Wednesday came out in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the basis for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall. The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers” coalition. The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday. It’s another sign of urgency for additional COVID aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn’t as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Dr. Scott Atlas, Trump’s coronavirus adviser, resigns from post WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump’s special adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Scott Atlas, formally resigned from his post on Monday, according to FOX News. “I am writing to resign from my position as Special Advisor to the President of the United States,” Atlas said in a resignation letter obtained by FOX News. “I worked hard with a singular focus—to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,” Atlas wrote, adding that he “always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.” “As time went on, like all scientists and health policy scholars, I learned new information and synthesized the latest data from around the world, all in an effort to provide you with the best information to serve the greater public good,” Atlas wrote. “But, perhaps more than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor.” “Indeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent,” Atlas said. Atlas had been criticized by health experts throughout his tenure for calling for a widespread reopening amid the surging pandemic and saying that lockdowns are “extremely harmful” to Americans. He listed among his accomplishments in his resignation letter that he “identified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children.” RELATED: Questions arise as COVID-19 vaccine gets closer to reality Atlas, the former chief of neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center and a fellow at Stanford’s conservative Hoover Institution, has no expertise in public health or infectious diseases. Atlas joined the White House Coronavirus Task Force in August amid ongoing tensions between the president and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the task force's coordinator. Many public health experts questioned Trump’s decision to bring Atlas, whose expertise is in magnetic resonance imaging and whose research has focused on factors impacting health care policy, on as a coronavirus adviser. His controversial views also prompted Stanford to issue a statement distancing itself from the faculty member, saying Atlas \"has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university’s approach in response to the pandemic.\" “We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing,” the university said Nov. 16. “We also believe in the importance of strictly following the guidance of local and state health authorities.” “I think he’s utterly unqualified to help lead a COVID response,” said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. “His medical degree isn’t even close to infectious diseases and public health and he has no experience in dealing with public health outbreaks.” RELATED: ‘Great Barrington Declaration’ on COVID-19 ‘herd immunity’ draws criticism from experts Gostin expressed concern that Trump was sidelining other doctors, including Birx and Fauci, because he had soured on their advice. “You want clear independent advice from people with long experience in fighting novel pandemics and he has none of those credentials,” Gostin said. Atlas found himself in hot water earlier in November after tweeting to his nearly 90,000 followers suggesting that residents of Michigan should “rise up” against COVID-19 restrictions imposed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration. “The only way this stops is if people rise up. You get what you accept. #FreedomMatters #StepUp,” the tweet, which was deleted by Twitter, read. Atlas later tweeted that he wasn’t “talking at all about violence.” “Hey. I NEVER was talking at all about violence. People vote, people peacefully protest. NEVER would I endorse or incite violence. NEVER,” Atlas tweeted. After the U.S. surpassed 6 million COVID-19 cases in August, Atlas downplayed the risk of infections in young people and agreed with Gov. Ron DeSantis that college football needed to be played this year. Atlas described fit athletes as low-risk and said football “can be done safely” using social distancing in big stadiums. Even with rigid guidelines and frequent testing which was implemented at the start of the college football season, universities have seen several outbreaks which have forced games to be postponed. Atlas also downplayed the need to test people for COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. “When you start a program of testing simply to detect positive cases among asymptomatic low-risk groups, the outcome from that is to close the schools,\" he said. \"And the goal of testing is not to close things. The goal of testing is to protect the vulnerable while we open the schools and open the economy.” In an April op-ed in The Hill, Atlas claimed that lockdowns may have prevented the development of “natural herd immunity.” “In the absence of immunization, society needs circulation of the virus, assuming high-risk people can be isolated,\" he wrote. In television appearances, Atlas called on the nation to “get a grip\" and argued that “there’s nothing wrong\" with having low-risk people get infected, as long as the vulnerable are protected. RELATED: U.S. could soon see 'surge upon a surge' in COVID cases, says Fauci While the term “herd immunity” has been widely used in conversation about the novel coronavirus, evidence has emerged that the concept of immunity obtained through widespread infection of a population may not apply to COVID-19. Epidemiologists define the herd immunity threshold for a given virus as the percentage of the population that must be immune to ensure that its introduction will not cause an outbreak. If enough people are immune, an infected person will likely come into contact only with people who are already immune rather than spreading the virus to someone who is susceptible. A study published on July 11 by researchers at King’s College London found that antibodies detected in the human body which fight the coronavirus declined after a few weeks, leaving the possibility of herd immunity out of the question. The implications of such a study engender the possibility that future waves of the novel coronavirus could return in seasons, according to researchers. Herd immunity is usually discussed in the context of vaccination. For example, if 90% of the population (the herd) has received a chickenpox vaccine, the remaining 10% (often including people who cannot become vaccinated, like babies and the immunocompromised) will be protected from the introduction of a single person with chickenpox. Even with two promising vaccines nearly ready to release to the public, doctors and health experts say that a majority of the population will need to get the inoculation in order for herd immunity to take hold. Dr. Natasha Bhuyan, a family physician with One Medical, is optimistic about the current data related to the two vaccines, but says 60% to 80% of the population will need to get vaccinated for herd immunity to become viable. \"We still need a majority of people to get the vaccine in order to reach herd immunity, and I think that as long as we can show the public the vaccine is safe and the vaccine is effective, then I think people will voluntarily get the vaccine,\" said Bhuyan.

You know that I will.\" Regarding the series of legal challenges in multiple states, Trump said: “A lot of things [are] happening between now and Jan. 20.” “It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede,” Trump later added. WHAT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP DOING ON THANKSGIVING? Asked if he would consider running again on the Republican ticket in 2024, Trump said, “I don’t want to talk to 2024 yet.” The president stated that the 2020 election results still “have a long way to go.” Trump also revealed he’d travel to Georgia on Saturday to campaign for GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to supper them in their runoff contests. He also said that people were “very disappointed we were robbed”’ in Georgia after the state certified its election results in favor of Biden. The Trump legal team was dealt a blow this week after Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada certified their election results. A Wednesday lawsuit from attorney Sidney Powell sought to decertify Georgia’s election result and award it to Trump. The lawsuit, which names Georgia Gov.

The president said the federal agency overseeing the handover must \"do what needs to be done\", even as he vowed to keep contesting his election defeat. The General Services Administration (GSA) said it was acknowledging Mr Biden as the \"apparent winner\". It came as Mr Biden's victory in the state of Michigan was officially certified, a major blow to Mr Trump. The GSA announcement means the president-elect now has access to top security briefings, office space and government officials as he prepares to take office on 20 January. His transition website has now changed to a US government domain. He will begin announcing the people he wants in the top jobs in his cabinet on Tuesday. How did the Biden team respond? It welcomed the start of the transition process as the Democratic president-elect gears up to be sworn in. \"Today's decision is a needed step to begin tackling the challenges facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track,\" a team statement said. Earlier, Mr Biden unveiled his nominations for his foreign policy and national security team, consisting of old colleagues from his years in the Obama administration. He is set to appoint Anthony Blinken as secretary of state and John Kerry as climate envoy, while Janet Yellen is tipped to be the first female US treasury secretary. The list of selections came ahead of a formal announcement Tuesday. Most of the appointments will require Senate confirmation. Has Trump conceded? Mr Trump tweeted as the GSA, which is tasked with formally beginning presidential changeovers, informed the Biden camp that it would start the transition process. GSA administrator Emily Murphy said she was making $6.3m (£4.7m) in funds available to the president-elect. Mr Trump said: \"In the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.\" He did not concede, however, and went on to repeat unsubstantiated claims of corruption, pledging to keep up the \"good fight\". It is worth noting that Mr Trump does not have to concede for Mr Biden to be sworn in as the 46th US president. Ms Murphy, a Trump appointee, cited \"recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results\" in her decision to start the transition process. She said she had received no pressure from the White House over the timing of the move. \"I did, however, receive threats online, by phone, and by mail directed at my safety, my family, my staff, and even my pets in an effort to coerce me into making this determination prematurely,\" Ms Murphy said in a letter to Mr Biden. \"Even in the face of thousands of threats I have remained committed to upholding the law.\" She had faced criticism from both political sides for failing to begin the transition process sooner, usually a routine step between the election and the inauguration. What has the Republican Party been saying? Although most of Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have united behind his refusal to accept defeat until now, some have increasingly been breaking rank. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring, said the president should \"put the country first\" and help Mr Biden succeed. \"When you are in public life, people remember the last thing you do.\" West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito said \"at some point, the 2020 election must end\". More than 160 business leaders had also urged Ms Murphy in an open letter to immediately recognise Mr Biden as president-elect. \"Withholding resources and vital information from an incoming administration puts the public and economic health and security of America at risk,″ they wrote. What happened in Michigan? Michigan is the latest hotly contested state to certify its election result, despite disputes from Mr Trump's campaign. Mr Biden won in Michigan by more than 154,000 votes. However, Mr Trump claimed voter fraud swayed the outcome, without offering evidence. The president's Republican allies had called for the certification - which finalises the outcome of a state's popular vote - to be delayed for two weeks to audit ballots in a heavily Democratic county. However, the Michigan Board of State Canvassers voted to certify the result on Monday. One of two Republicans on the Michigan State Board of Canvassers joined the two Democrats to finalise the outcome. The other Republican board member, Norman Shinkle, abstained, suggesting delaying the certification over irregularities affecting a few hundred votes in one county. Mr Biden will now receive all 16 of the state's votes in the US Electoral College, which is expected to approve Mr Biden's victory on 14 December. Mr Trump's legal team said they would still challenge Michigan's results. What about Trump's other legal challenges? Mr Trump and his allies have suffered a string of court defeats in key states as they race to challenge the results. In Pennsylvania, a Republican judge on Saturday ruled that the Trump campaign had tried to \"disenfranchise almost seven million voters\" with no real evidence. The president's lawyers have appealed now to the Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. The president's other legal efforts in the state have failed to change Mr Biden's lead of some 80,000 votes. The Trump campaign has also called for another recount in Georgia, after an earlier recount by hand confirmed Mr Biden's win in the state. In Wisconsin, a partial recount is under way by request of the Trump campaign. Election officials have accused Trump supporters of obstructing the state's recount of votes.

The CDC warning could shelve travelers plans to leave home and force some to celebrate virtually. While the agency’s latest guidance stresses that “postponing travel and staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others,” it included safety precautions people should take, such as getting a flu shot before the trip, wearing a mask at all times, and bringing extra masks and hand sanitizer. The CDC also suggested people host their celebration outside and bring their own food, plates, and utensils in order to mitigate spread during dinner. “What’s at stake is inadvertently someone is infected in that particular household, in that larger family and then spreads it to others, they become infected, and then they go back to their own community, and then that infection is spread to someone else,” Dr. Henry Walke, the CDC’s COVID-19 incident manager, said Thursday. The new guidance comes on the heels of hitting a grim milestone on Wednesday: More than 250,000 people have died due to COVID-19 in the U.S. Government officials have ramped up appeals for people to celebrate the holiday in their own homes. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said Wednesday that people should “think twice” about indoor gatherings in the coming weeks. “As we get into the colder weather, we should really think twice about these kind of dinner parties where you’re not sure of whether the people that are in your bubble (are safe),” Fauci told USA Today. “Then, you’re going to start seeing these unanticipated infections related to innocent home gatherings, particularly as we head into the holiday season.” To date, more than 11.5 million infections and nearly 251,000 deaths due to COVID-19 have been confirmed in the U.S.", "output": "right"}

Shortly after the results were released, The Associated Press called Joe Biden as the winner of the state. The AP called Biden the winner of the presidential race on Nov. 7. The full hand recount of the state's 5 million presidential votes resulted in a narrowing of Biden's lead over President Trump in Georgia, but not nearly enough to change the result. He started out with a 14,000 vote lead, and now leads by just over 12,000 votes. The recount, formally known as a risk-limiting audit, is intended to verify the contest's winner. As Georgia Public Broadcasting's Stephen Fowler reported, four counties uncovered a few thousand previously uncounted votes, which subsequently cut into Biden's margin of victory. Douglas, Walton, Fayette and Floyd counties all experienced issues with missing or unscanned votes related to human error — but the numbers weren't significant enough to change the outcome of the election. Loading... There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law does allow for a recount if the margin is less than .5%. It currently stands at .2%. Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced the hand audit last week, citing the close margin of the race. The four counties with new vote totals must recertify their results. Statewide election results must be certified by Friday. The Trump campaign then has until Tuesday to request an additional recount, which would be by machine rather than by hand. Trump has repeatedly questioned the integrity of Georgia's vote counting, calling it both a \"joke\" and a process that led to \"fraudulent votes\" being found. But Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system implementation manager, said on Wednesday that the system is working exactly the way it is intended. \"The irony of [Trump] saying 'fraudulent votes have been found' — he has gained in the finding of these votes,\" he said. Raffensperger has said he's been pressured by top Republicans to find ways of disqualifying ballots that hurt the Trump campaign. \"They say that as pressure builds, it reveals your character, it doesn't change your character. Some people aren't behaving too well with seeing where the results are,\" Raffensperger told NPR's Ari Shapiro on Tuesday. \"At the end of the day, I want voters to understand that when they cast their ballot in Georgia, it will be accurately counted.

For well over a year, Mr Krebs and his cyber-security team had been gaming scenarios about what could go wrong. At one point, he said his greatest fear was that voter registration databases might be interfered with to stop people voting. He also talked about the concern that on election night, media organisations might be hacked to prevent people knowing the results and create confusion. The experience of Russian hacking and interference in 2016 had led the whole US national security community to prepare for a re-run in 2020. But in the end that was a threat that never materialised. Perhaps that was because of the defensive work by Mr Krebs and colleagues or perhaps because of the way the National Security Agency went on the offensive against hackers in Russia and elsewhere to deter and stop them. But it was also perhaps because foreign actors decided they did not need to do very much to stir up divisions - since they were so deeply entrenched inside America already. The fear of misinformation led to the establishment of the Rumour Control website under Mr Krebs and this brought him into conflict with his own president. Votes had been cast by dead people and were being counted. False, the site said. A bad actor could change results without detection. Again, false, it said, providing details of why that could not be the case. If results change in the days after the initial count, they cannot be trusted and have been compromised. Again, a big red cross on the website indicated this was not true. This all directly contradicted assertions that Donald Trump and some of his allies were relying on to challenge the integrity of the result. President Trump himself cited reports that a particular voting machine had deleted 2.7 million votes, while his campaign suggested dead people had voted in Georgia. Mr Krebs' own Twitter account as well as the website maintained a steady and consistent message - the vote had not been rigged. A statement on 12 November by a group of officials posted on Mr Krebs' Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) website described the election as \"the most secure in American history\". \"There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised,\" one line from the statement said - in bold to add emphasis. Less than a week later, Mr Krebs was \"terminated\" by a presidential tweet. Mr Krebs was highly regarded within the cyber-security community. \"He built Cisa into a major player on the global cybersecurity stage,\" Ciaran Martin, who ran the UK's closest equivalent body until September, told the BBC. \"His work on election security is his crowning achievement. It brought together everything he'd built: the ability to harness elite national security capabilities to protect small local government bodies that run elections. \"And he fearlessly communicated the truth about what were real threats, and what weren't.\" His firing was the latest - and not necessarily the last - chapter in the long battle between President Trump and his own national security community. At issue from the start has been the legitimacy of both election campaigns he has fought in. His presidency began with him lashing out at his own spies for their assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 to support his candidacy. That began a long tussle in which the president almost appeared to see a zero-sum battle; one in which he sought to undermine the credibility of his own spies to avoid any question being raised about his victory. The tension has ebbed and flowed, with some officials sacked and others walking a fine line to try and protect themselves and their own institutions. But the 2020 election result has led it to explode again. In 2016, Donald Trump was angry at claims there had been election interference. This time his anger is at the refusal of those like Chris Krebs to back up his claims that there was.

Raffensperger, a Republican, told the Post he was under pressure from within his own party during the recount to bring about a more favorable outcome for President Trump in the state, which Joe Biden narrowly won with roughly 14,000 votes. In their conversation, Graham questioned Raffensperger about the state’s signature-matching law and whether political bias could have prompted poll workers to accept ballots with nonmatching signatures, according to Raffensperger. Graham also asked whether Raffensperger had the power to toss all mail ballots in counties found to have higher rates of nonmatching signatures, Raffensperger said. Raffensperger said he was stunned that Graham appeared to suggest that he find a way to toss legally cast ballots. Absent court intervention, Raffensperger doesn’t have the power to do what Graham suggested because counties administer elections in Georgia. “It sure looked like he was wanting to go down that road,” Raffensperger said.

Many of these rumors centered around a piece of software from Dominion Voting Systems. We've addressed a few of these rumors in a previous article, but the most prevalent claim, and one that was spread by U.S. President Donald Trump himself on Nov. 12, 2020, was that Dominion software had deleted 2.7 million votes that had been cast for the incumbent: There is no truth to this claim. On Nov. 12, 2020, a coalition of federal and state officials, including members of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), released a statement calling the 2020 election the \"most secure in American history.\" The statement went on to specifically address Trump's false claim about votes being deleted, writing that \"there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" Here is the statement in full: The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised. Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020. While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections. Trump did not provide any evidence to support his false claim that 2.7 million votes were deleted by Dominion Software, but he did tag Channel Rion and One American News Network (OAN), a far-right web publisher that recently reported on these unsubstantiated claims. The OAN segment (which was archived by Mediate) claimed that an \"unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research\" found that Dominion Voting Systems \"switched as many as 435,000 votes from President Trump to Joe Biden\" and that \"another 2.7 million Trump votes appear to have been deleted by Dominion.\" Edison Research President Larry Rosin, however, disputed these claims. In a statement to the The Dispatch Fact Check, Rosin said: \"Edison Research created no such report and we are not aware of any voter fraud.\" A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems issued a similar statement to the Denver Post: \"Dominion Voting Systems categorically denies any claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems.

It didn’t work out that way. More than 12 hours after polls closed, Biden held a narrow lead in some key states with hundreds of thousands of votes yet to be counted, and he has a comfortable advantage in the national popular vote. But as of midday Wednesday, there was no clear Democratic wave. Republicans held key Senate seats that Democrats hoped to flip, and the GOP may ultimately shrink the Democrats’ House majority. And even if Trump were to ultimately lose, the closeness of the presidential contest raised the prospect that a Biden presidency would have difficulty enacting progressive priorities or quickly move past the cultural and partisan fissures of the Trump era. “The Trump coalition is more stubborn and resilient and capable than maybe we anticipated,” said Rep. Gerald Connolly, a six-term Democratic lawmaker from Virginia. “The country is even more polarized and divided.” While Trump’s critics were deeply disappointed that the hoped-for blue wave never materialized, Biden’s allies encouraged the political world to step back and see the big picture. Dan Pfeiffer, a former aide to President Barack Obama, posted a message to Democrats on Medium entitled, “Biden is winning, act like it.” “The Republicans are already trying to neuter his ability to govern by casting aspersions about how he won,” Pfeiffer wrote. “We cannot let them do that. The stakes are too damn high.” Indeed, should Trump lose, no matter the margin, he would be the first incumbent president to fail to win reelection since 1992. Biden has already flipped two states Trump carried four years ago, Arizona and Wisconsin, and held a modest lead in at least one other, Michigan, as he moved toward rebuilding the Democrats’ so-called “Blue Wall.” “Today, the vice president will garner more votes than any presidential candidates in history,” Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters Wednesday. She added: “I feel like we had been abundantly clear that we thought this could be a close race.” Still, polls heading into Election Day suggested a much better election for Democrats up and down the ballot but clearly missed a surge of support for Trump and Republicans with turnout high across the political spectrum. Several once-promising Democratic Senate challengers far fell short, despite a deluge of national fundraising support for headliners like Jaime Harrison in South Carolina, Amy McGrath in Kentucky and MJ Hegar in Texas. Some House freshmen who helped give Democrats a majority in 2018 also lost, victims of stronger-than-expected performances for many Republican challengers. Democrats’ gains in metro and suburban areas were matched or offset in many battleground states by a Republican deluge in small towns and rural areas. And in a warning sign for Democrats, Trump demonstrated an uptick of support in some Black and Latino communities. “You certainly had a lot of Latinos voting for him in south Texas and following him down the ballot,” said Texas Democratic Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, who started Election Day with hopes of flipping several congressional districts and gaining control of the Texas state House. Neither happened. “It’s very difficult to understand how there was such a big difference between what the polling was showing and what ultimately came out,” he said. “To say it was a surprise is an understatement.” The evolving landscape represents a conundrum for a party that has a clearer claim to national majority support than the GOP. If trends hold, Democrats will have won the popular vote in seven out of the last eight presidential elections -- with President George W. Bush in 2004 being the lone Republican popular vote winner since his father’s landslide victory in 1988. One of Biden’s principal arguments in a crowded Democratic presidential primary campaign was that he could expand Democrats’ coalition to include more older voters, independents, and even moderate Republicans. He appeared to underperform among other key demographics, however, or at least not expand the alliance enough to quash Trump’s base and remake Capitol Hill. To be sure, Biden performed better than Hillary Clinton four years earlier in states like Iowa, Ohio, and Texas. But he also failed to win any of them. Democrats clung to the hope that Biden might eke out narrow victories in North Carolina and Georgia. Veteran Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said it would be short-sighted to call Democrats’ performance a failure when they were on track to resurrect the “Blue Wall” — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — while flipping Arizona with a chance to claim Georgia, two states that haven’t gone Democratic in presidential elections since the 1990s. Ferguson noted that Biden was on track to do so while offering “the most progressive agenda of any Democratic nominee” in the modern era. “The last time an incumbent president was defeated was 28 years ago,” Ferguson said. “Incumbent presidents don’t often lose, and this one is going to lose and lose resoundingly.” He added: “Elections are about where the votes end up, not how you felt while the counting was happening.” Ferguson and Hinojosa agreed that the mixed results suggest Democrats don’t have to entertain a fundamental overhaul. In Texas, Hinojosa said Trump could hold appeal with Latinos that doesn’t translate into long-term party loyalty. And he said Democrats hamstrung themselves by going months not canvassing in-person because of the coronavirus pandemic, while the GOP’s field operation reached voters directly. “I’m not saying it was the wrong decision given the situation, but it affected us,” he said. “We were taking a knife into a gunfight.” ___ Barrow reported from Atlanta.

Trump appeared in the East Room of the White House early on Wednesday morning to claim falsely that he had already beaten Democrat Joe Biden, and the election was being stolen from him in a massive act of fraud. He vowed to mount a challenge in the Supreme Court and declared that he had already won states that were still counting votes, including Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The election has not yet been won, and the President and the former vice president are still locked in a tight battle for the decisive states with millions of votes still being counted. Trump’s remarks essentially amounted to a demand for the legally cast votes of American citizens not to be recorded in a historic act of disenfranchisement. And they brought closer the potential constitutional nightmare that many have feared since Trump started to tarnish an election that he apparently worried he could lose months ago. His rhetorical broadside was also notable because it came at a moment of huge tension in a deeply divided nation – a time when a president, even one whose political fate is in the process of being written – could be expected to call for calm. Trump’s comments were especially remarkable since it appears that the President has a good chance of winning outstanding states in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and Michigan, which could hand him a second term. And the implication of his authoritarian remarks was that the President wants vote counting to stop in those states but to go on in Arizona, where he trails Biden. They were also a warning sign of the kind of behavior that might be expected in a second term from a President who has survived impeachment and may be heading for a new mandate that he would view as a validation of his norm-crushing behavior. In some ways, Trump’s aggressive response to a night of nail-biting tension and a yet-to-be-decided result could also take the gloss from what would be a stunning political achievement if he wins reelection despite expectations that his handling of the pandemic would cause the country to turn against him. “Millions and millions of people voted for us,” Trump said in the East Room. “A very sad group of people is trying to disenfranchise that group of people.” Trump wary of early and mail-in votes Trump is angry that hundreds of thousands of mail-in and early votes – cast disproportionately by Democrats – are still being counted, leaving open the possibility that Biden could challenge Trump’s leads in the Midwest. But those votes were made in a way that is just as legitimate as the ballots that were lodged by voters showing up in their precincts in the traditional manner. “We were getting ready for a big celebration. We were winning everything. And all of a sudden it was just called off,” Trump said. “This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country.” “Frankly, we did win this election,” he said, despite millions of votes still outstanding. The President made his televised statement after his opponent delivered his own remarks and said that all of the votes must be counted. “It’s not my place or Donald Trump’s place to declare who has won this election,” Biden told his crowd in Wilmington, Delaware. Throughout his presidency, Trump has consistently taken aim at the institutions that have underpinned American government for decades. He has attacked the judiciary, the intelligence services and made clear for example that he believes that the Justice Department should be loyal to him rather than the law. He has even said that as president he has absolute power under the Constitution to do whatever he wants. “I have an Article Two where I have the right to do whatever I want as President,” Trump declared last year. ‘Legally cast ballots’ It was not immediately clear on what grounds Trump planned to try to ask the Supreme Court to intervene in the election because, so far, he has not provided evidence for any voting irregularities. “These are legally cast ballots or at least will be determined to be legally cast ballots by the appropriate local county and state officials,” Benjamin Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer, told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “And for a president to say we are going to disenfranchise those legally cast ballots – it really is extraordinary.” The President’s statement sparked a sharp response from Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon. “It was outrageous because it is a naked effort to take away the democratic rights of American citizens,” she said in a written statement. “The counting will not stop.” And former New Jersey governor and top Trump ally Chris Christie voiced disagreement with Trump’s election night remarks prematurely declaring victory and attacking legitimate vote counting efforts. Christie said Trump “undercut his own credibility.” “There’s just no basis to make that argument tonight. There just isn’t. All these votes have to be counted that are in now,” Christie said during a panel on ABC News moments after Trump’s remarks, noting that the vote count in Pennsylvania will continue for days and “that argument’s for later.”", "output": "left"}

It is the second day in a row the country has broken its daily new case record after reporting more than 91,000 infections on Thursday. More than nine million total cases have been reported in the US, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden comes to a head on Tuesday. Twenty-one states are experiencing outbreaks, with some of the most severe in the states that will be key in deciding the 2020 election. In the battleground state of Wisconsin, hospitals in Green Bay warned that President Trump's Friday rally there could make the outbreak worse. \"It is more important now than ever to avoid large crowds, especially here in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where we are seeing some of the most rapid spread of Covid-19 in the United States,\" a joint statement from several hospitals said. On Friday, ahead of his scheduled rallies, Mr Trump tweeted: \"More Testing equals more Cases. We have best testing. Deaths WAY DOWN.\" At recent Trump rallies, attendees have been screened and given masks. The events have also been held outdoors due to the pandemic. But there has not been social distancing, and some supporters continue to avoid masks. Mr Biden has also continued to campaign, though the Democrat's rallies have enforced social distancing practices, opting to have people attend inside their cars, for example. Mr Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, made an appearance on Fox News on Thursday where he repeated his father's line that the pandemic is under control. \"I went through the [Centers for Disease Control] data, because I kept hearing about new infections,\" the younger Mr Trump said. \"But I was like, 'Well, why aren't they talking about deaths?' Oh, because the number is almost nothing. Because we've gotten control of this and we understand how it works.\" Johns Hopkins University says the US has reported more than 229,000 deaths due to Covid-19. The daily death toll has risen by more than 1,000 three days this month, according to Reuters news agency. US health experts are warning the case load and death toll will continue to rise as the flu season coincides with the outbreaks. Infectious disease expert and White House coronavirus task force member Dr Anthony Fauci told CNBC on Wednesday that the nation was \"going in the wrong direction\". \"If things do not change, if they continue on the course we're on, there's going to be a whole lot of pain in this country with regard to additional cases and hospitalisations and deaths.\" Analysis - Naomi Grimley, Global Affairs Correspondent Data from the US continues to shock the world. Total case figures are almost at the nine million mark, and the seven-day average is more than 75,000 new infections daily. Half of US states have seen new peaks in the last month. There's been some talk of a \"third wave\" but many public health experts think that glosses over an inconvenient truth - that the US never really came out of the first one. Whereas Europe's epidemiological graph looks like the cross-section of a valley between two peaks, America's looks more like a series of three steps. After the terrible spring when the virus was at its worst in the North East, such as in New York, cases did fall to around 20,000 a day across the country in early summer. But then the Sun Belt states, such as Arizona, Florida and Texas, reopened for business and we saw surges begin there instead. Cases never had chance to drop to what Dr Fauci would have preferred - a base of something akin to 10,000 a day. Now, after a bit of a fall at the start of September, cases are surging again. There's widespread transmission across the country, with states in the Midwest such as North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Minnesota worst affected.", "output": "center"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "My Resignation From The Intercept The same trends of repression, censorship and ideological homogeneity plaguing the national press generally have engulfed the media outlet I co-founded, culminating in censorship of my own articles. Today I sent my intention to resign from The Intercept, the news outlet I co-founded in 2013 with Jeremy Scahill and Laura Poitras, as well as from its parent company First Look Media. The final, precipitating cause is that The Intercept’s editors, in violation of my contractual right of editorial freedom, censored an article I wrote this week, refusing to publish it unless I remove all sections critical of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, the candidate vehemently supported by all New-York-based Intercept editors involved in this effort at suppression. The censored article, based on recently revealed emails and witness testimony, raised critical questions about Biden’s conduct. Not content to simply prevent publication of this article at the media outlet I co-founded, these Intercept editors also demanded that I refrain from exercising a separate contractual right to publish this article with any other publication. I had no objection to their disagreement with my views of what this Biden evidence shows: as a last-ditch attempt to avoid being censored, I encouraged them to air their disagreements with me by writing their own articles that critique my perspectives and letting readers decide who is right, the way any confident and healthy media outlet would. But modern media outlets do not air dissent; they quash it. So censorship of my article, rather than engagement with it, was the path these Biden-supporting editors chose. The censored article will be published on this page shortly (it is now published here, and the emails with Intercept editors showing the censorship are here). My letter of intent to resign, which I sent this morning to First Look Media’s President Michael Bloom, is published below. As of now, I will be publishing my journalism here on Substack, where numerous other journalists, including my good friend, the great intrepid reporter Matt Taibbi, have come in order to practice journalism free of the increasingly repressive climate that is engulfing national mainstream media outlets across the country. This was not an easy choice: I am voluntarily sacrificing the support of a large institution and guaranteed salary in exchange for nothing other than a belief that there are enough people who believe in the virtues of independent journalism and the need for free discourse who will be willing to support my work by subscribing. Like anyone with young children, a family and numerous obligations, I do this with some trepidation, but also with the conviction that there is no other choice. I could not sleep at night knowing that I allowed any institution to censor what I want to say and believe — least of all a media outlet I co-founded with the explicit goal of ensuring this never happens to other journalists, let alone to me, let alone because I have written an article critical of a powerful Democratic politician vehemently supported by the editors in the imminent national election. But the pathologies, illiberalism, and repressive mentality that led to the bizarre spectacle of my being censored by my own media outlet are ones that are by no means unique to The Intercept. These are the viruses that have contaminated virtually every mainstream center-left political organization, academic institution, and newsroom. I began writing about politics fifteen years ago with the goal of combatting media propaganda and repression, and — regardless of the risks involved — simply cannot accept any situation, no matter how secure or lucrative, that forces me to submit my journalism and right of free expression to its suffocating constraints and dogmatic dictates. From the time I began writing about politics in 2005, journalistic freedom and editorial independence have been sacrosanct to me. Fifteen years ago, I created a blog on the free Blogspot software when I was still working as a lawyer: not with any hopes or plans of starting a new career as a journalist, but just as a citizen concerned about what I was seeing with the War on Terror and civil liberties, and wanting to express what I believed needed to be heard. It was a labor of love, based in an ethos of cause and conviction, dependent upon a guarantee of complete editorial freedom. It thrived because the readership I built knew that, even when they disagreed with particular views I was expressing, I was a free and independent voice, unwedded to any faction, controlled by nobody, endeavoring to be as honest as possible about what I was seeing, and always curious about the wisdom of seeing things differently. The title I chose for that blog, “Unclaimed Territory,” reflected that spirit of liberation from captivity to any fixed political or intellectual dogma or institutional constraints. When Salon offered me a job as a columnist in 2007, and then again when the Guardian did the same in 2012, I accepted their offers on the condition that I would have the right, except in narrowly defined situations (such as articles that could create legal liability for the news outlet), to publish my articles and columns directly to the internet without censorship, advanced editorial interference, or any other intervention permitted or approval needed. Both outlets revamped their publication system to accommodate this condition, and over the many years I worked with them, they always honored those commitments. When I left the Guardian at the height of the Snowden reporting in 2013 in order to create a new media outlet, I did not do so, needless to say, in order to impose upon myself more constraints and restrictions on my journalistic independence. The exact opposite was true: the intended core innovation of The Intercept, above all else, was to create a new media outlets where all talented, responsible journalists would enjoy the same right of editorial freedom I had always insisted upon for myself. As I told former New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller in a 2013 exchange we had in The New York Times about my critiques of mainstream journalism and the idea behind The Intercept: “editors should be there to empower and enable strong, highly factual, aggressive adversarial journalism, not to serve as roadblocks to neuter or suppress the journalism.” When the three of us as co-founders made the decision early on that we would not attempt to manage the day-to-day operations of the new outlet, so that we could instead focus on our journalism, we negotiated the right of approval for senior editors and, especially the editor-in-chief. The central responsibility of the person holding that title was to implement, in close consultation with us, the unique journalistic vision and journalistic values on which we founded this new media outlet. Chief among those values was editorial freedom, the protection of a journalist’s right to speak in an honest voice, and the airing rather than suppression of dissent from mainstream orthodoxies and even collegial disagreements with one another. That would be accomplished, above all else, by ensuring that journalists, once they fulfilled the first duty of factual accuracy and journalistic ethics, would be not just permitted but encouraged to express political and ideological views that deviated from mainstream orthodoxy and those of their own editors; to express themselves in their own voice of passion and conviction rather stuffed into the corporatized, contrived tone of artificial objectivity, above-it-all omnipotence; and to be completely free of anyone else’s dogmatic beliefs or ideological agenda — including those of the three co-founders. The current iteration of The Intercept is completely unrecognizable when compared to that original vision. Rather than offering a venue for airing dissent, marginalized voices and unheard perspectives, it is rapidly becoming just another media outlet with mandated ideological and partisan loyalties, a rigid and narrow range of permitted viewpoints (ranging from establishment liberalism to soft leftism, but always anchored in ultimate support for the Democratic Party), a deep fear of offending hegemonic cultural liberalism and center-left Twitter luminaries, and an overarching need to secure the approval and admiration of the very mainstream media outlets we created The Intercept to oppose, critique and subvert. As a result, it is a rare event indeed when a radical freelance voice unwelcome in mainstream precincts is published in The Intercept. Outside reporters or writers with no claim to mainstream acceptability — exactly the people we set out to amplify — have almost no chance of being published. It is even rarer for The Intercept to publish content that would not fit very comfortably in at least a dozen or more center-left publications of similar size which pre-dated its founding, from Mother Jones to Vox and even MSNBC. Courage is required to step out of line, to question and poke at those pieties most sacred in one’s own milieu, but fear of alienating the guardians of liberal orthodoxy, especially on Twitter, is the predominant attribute of The Intercept’s New-York based editorial leadership team. As a result, The Intercept has all but abandoned its core mission of challenging and poking at, rather than appeasing and comforting, the institutions and guardians most powerful in its cultural and political circles. Making all of this worse, The Intercept — while gradually excluding the co-founders from any role in its editorial mission or direction, and making one choice after the next to which I vocally objected as a betrayal of our core mission — continued publicly to trade on my name in order to raise funds for journalism it knew I did not support. It purposely allowed the perception to fester that I was the person responsible for its journalistic mistakes in order to ensure that blame for those mistakes was heaped on me rather than the editors who were consolidating control and were responsible for them. The most egregious, but by no means only, example of exploiting my name to evade responsibility was the Reality Winner debacle. As The New York Times recently reported, that was a story in which I had no involvement whatsoever. While based in Brazil, I was never asked to work on the documents which Winner sent to our New York newsroom with no request that any specific journalist work on them. I did not even learn of the existence of that document until very shortly prior to its publication. The person who oversaw, edited and controlled that story was Betsy Reed, which was how it should be given the magnitude and complexity of that reporting and her position as editor-in-chief. It was Intercept editors who pressured the story’s reporters to quickly send those documents for authentication to the government — because they was eager to prove to mainstream media outlets and prominent liberals that The Intercept was willing to get on board the Russiagate train. They wanted to counter-act the perception, created by my articles expressing skepticism about the central claims of that scandal, that The Intercept had stepped out of line on a story of high importance to U.S. liberalism and even the left. That craving — to secure the approval of the very mainstream media outlets we set out to counteract — was the root cause for the speed and recklessness with which that document from Winner was handled. But The Intercept, to this very day, has refused to provide any public accounting of what happened in the Reality Winner story: to explain who the editors were who made mistakes and why any of it happened. As the New York Times article makes clear, that refusal persists to this very day notwithstanding vocal demands from myself, Scahill, Laura Poitras and others that The Intercept, as an institution that demands transparency from others, has the obligation to provide it for itself. The reason for this silence and this cover-up is obvious: accounting to the public about what happened with the Reality Winner story would reveal who the actual editors are who are responsible for that deeply embarrassing newsroom failure, and that would negate their ability to continue to hide behind me and let the public continue to assume that I was the person at fault for a reporting process from which I was completely excluded from the start. That is just one example illustrating the frustrating dilemma of having a newsroom exploit my name, work and credibility when it is convenient to do so, while increasingly denying me any opportunity to influence its journalistic mission and editorial direction, all while pursuing an editorial mission completely anathema to what I believe. Despite all of this, I did not want to leave The Intercept. As it deteriorated and abandoned its original mission, I reasoned to myself — perhaps rationalized — that as long as The Intercept at least continued to provide me the resources to personally do the journalism I believe in, and never to interfere in or impede my editorial freedom, I could swallow everything else. But the brute censorship this week of my article — about the Hunter Biden materials and Joe Biden’s conduct regarding Ukraine and China, as well my critique of the media’s rank-closing attempt, in a deeply unholy union with Silicon Valley and the “intelligence community,” to suppress its revelations — eroded the last justification I could cling to for staying. It meant that not only does this media outlet not provide the editorial freedom to other journalists, as I had so hopefully envisioned seven years ago, but now no longer even provides it to me. In the days heading into a presidential election, I am somehow silenced from expressing any views that random editors in New York find disagreeable, and now somehow have to conform my writing and reporting to cater to their partisan desires and eagerness to elect specific candidates. To say that such censorship is a red line for me, a situation I would never accept no matter the cost, is an understatement. It is astonishing to me, but also a reflection of our current discourse and illiberal media environment, that I have been silenced about Joe Biden by my own media outlet. Numerous other episodes were also contributing causes to my decision to leave: the Reality Winner cover-up; the decision to hang Lee Fang out to dry and even force him to apologize when a colleague tried to destroy his reputation by publicly, baselessly and repeatedly branding him a racist; its refusal to report on the daily proceedings of the Assange extradition hearing because the freelance reporter doing an outstanding job was politically distasteful; its utter lack of editorial standards when it comes to viewpoints or reporting that flatter the beliefs of its liberal base (The Intercept published some of the most credulous and false affirmations of maximalist Russiagate madness, and, horrifyingly, took the lead in falsely branding the Hunter Biden archive as “Russian disinformation” by mindlessly and uncritically citing — of all things — a letter by former CIA officials that contained this baseless insinuation). I know it sounds banal to say, but — even with all of these frustrations and failures — I am leaving, and writing this, with genuine sadness, not fury. That news outlet is something I and numerous close friends and colleagues poured an enormous amount of our time, energy, passion and love into building. The Intercept has done great work. Its editorial leaders and First Look’s managers steadfastly supported the difficult and dangerous reporting I did last year with my brave young colleagues at The Intercept Brasil to expose corruption at the highest levels of the Bolsonaro government, and stood behind us as we endured threats of death and imprisonment. It continues to employ some of my closest friends, outstanding journalists whose work — when it overcomes editorial resistance — produces nothing but the highest admiration from me: Jeremy Scahill, Lee Fang, Murtaza Hussain, Naomi Klein, Ryan Grim and others. And I have no personal animus for anyone there, nor any desire to hurt it as an institution. Betsy Reed is an exceptionally smart editor and a very good human being with whom I developed a close and valuable friendship. And Pierre Omidyar, the original funder and publisher of First Look, always honored his personal commitment never to interfere in our editorial process even when I was publishing articles directly at odds with his strongly held views and even when I was attacking other institutions he was funding. I’m not leaving out of vengeance or personal conflict but out of conviction and cause. And none of the critiques I have voiced about The Intercept are unique to it. To the contrary: these are the raging battles over free expression and the right of dissent raging within every major cultural, political and journalistic institution. That’s the crisis that journalism, and more broadly values of liberalism, faces. Our discourse is becoming increasingly intolerant of dissenting views, and our culture is demanding more and more submission to prevailing orthodoxies imposed by self-anointed monopolists of Truth and Righteousness, backed up by armies of online enforcement mobs. And nothing is crippled by that trend more severely than journalism, which, above all else, requires the ability of journalists to offend and anger power centers, question or reject sacred pieties, unearth facts that reflect negatively even on (especially on) the most beloved and powerful figures, and highlight corruption no matter where it is found and regardless of who is benefited or injured by its exposure. Prior to the extraordinary experience of being censored this week by my own news outlet, I had already been exploring the possibility of creating a new media outlet. I have spent a couple of months in active discussions with some of the most interesting, independent and vibrant journalists, writers and commentators across the political spectrum about the feasibility of securing financing for a new outlet that would be designed to combat these trends. The first two paragraphs of our working document reads as follows: American media is gripped in a polarized culture war that is forcing journalism to conform to tribal, groupthink narratives that are often divorced from the truth and cater to perspectives that are not reflective of the broader public but instead a minority of hyper-partisan elites. The need to conform to highly restrictive, artificial cultural narratives and partisan identities has created a repressive and illiberal environment in which vast swaths of news and reporting either do not happen or are presented through the most skewed and reality-detached lens. With nearly all major media institutions captured to some degree by this dynamic, a deep need exists for media that is untethered and free to transgress the boundaries of this polarized culture war and address a demand from a public that is starved for media that doesn’t play for a side but instead pursues lines of reporting, thought, and inquiry wherever they lead, without fear of violating cultural pieties or elite orthodoxies. I have definitely not relinquished hope that this ambitious project can be accomplished. And I theoretically could have stayed at The Intercept until then, guaranteeing a stable and secure income for my family by swallowing the dictates of my new censors. But I would be deeply ashamed if I did that, and believe I would be betraying my own principles and convictions that I urge others to follow. So in the meantime, I have decided to follow in the footsteps of numerous other writers and journalists who have been expelled from increasingly repressive journalistic precincts for various forms of heresy and dissent and who have sought refuge here. I hope to exploit the freedom this new platform offers not only to continue to publish the independent and hard-hitting investigative journalism and candid analysis and opinion writing that my readers have come to expect, but also to develop a podcast, and continue the YouTube program, “System Update,” I launched earlier this year in partnership with The Intercept. To do that, to make this viable, I will need your support: people who are able to subscribe and sign up for the newsletter attached to this platform will enable my work to thrive and still be heard, perhaps even more so than before. I began my journalism career by depending on my readers’ willingness to support independent journalism which they believe is necessary to sustain. It is somewhat daunting at this point in my life, but also very exciting, to return to that model where one answers only to the public a journalist should be serving. * * * * * * * * LETTER OF INTENT TO RESIGN -------- Forwarded Message -------- Subject: ResignationDate: Thu, 29 Oct 2020 10:20:54 -0300From: Glenn Greenwald <xxxxxxxx@theintercept.com>To: Michael Bloom <xxxxxxxxx@firstlook.media>, Betsy Reed <xxxxxxx@theintercept.com> Michael - I am writing to advise you that I have decided that I will be resigning from First Look Media (FLM) and The Intercept. The precipitating (but by no means only) cause is that The Intercept is attempting to censor my articles in violation of both my contract and fundamental principles of editorial freedom. The latest and perhaps most egregious example is an opinion column I wrote this week which, five days before the presidential election, is critical of Joe Biden, the candidate who happens to be vigorously supported by all of the Intercept editors in New York who are imposing the censorship and refusing to publish the article unless I agree to remove all of the sections critical of the candidate they want to win. All of that violates the right in my contract with FLM to publish articles without editorial interference except in very narrow circumstances that plainly do not apply here. Worse, The Intercept editors in New York, not content to censor publication of my article at the Intercept, are also demanding that I not exercise my separate contractual right with FLM regarding articles I have written but which FLM does not want to publish itself. Under my contract, I have the right to publish any articles FLM rejects with another publication. But Intercept editors in New York are demanding I not only accept their censorship of my article at The Intercept, but also refrain from publishing it with any other journalistic outlet, and are using thinly disguised lawyer-crafted threats to coerce me not to do so (proclaiming it would be “detrimental” to The Intercept if I published it elsewhere). I have been extremely disenchanted and saddened by the editorial direction of The Intercept under its New York leadership for quite some time. The publication we founded without those editors back in 2014 now bears absolutely no resemblance to what we set out to build -- not in content, structure, editorial mission or purpose. I have grown embarrassed to have my name used as a fund-raising tool to support what it is doing and for editors to use me as a shield to hide behind to avoid taking responsibility for their mistakes (including, but not only, with the Reality Winner debacle, for which I was publicly blamed despite having no role in it, while the editors who actually were responsible for those mistakes stood by silently, allowing me to be blamed for their errors and then covering-up any public accounting of what happened, knowing that such transparency would expose their own culpability). But all this time, as things worsened, I reasoned that as long as The Intercept remained a place where my own right of journalistic independence was not being infringed, I could live with all of its other flaws. But now, not even that minimal but foundational right is being honored for my own journalism, suppressed by an increasingly authoritarian, fear-driven, repressive editorial team in New York bent on imposing their own ideological and partisan preferences on all writers while ensuring that nothing is published at The Intercept that contradicts their own narrow, homogenous ideological and partisan views: exactly what The Intercept, more than any other goal, was created to prevent. I have asked my lawyer to get in touch with FLM to discuss how best to terminate my contract. Thank you - Glenn Greenwald", "output": "center"}

Among those 17.5 million voters, Democrats hold a nearly 2 million vote advantage over Republicans, with roughly 7.5 million votes coming from registered Democrats and 5.5 million from registered Republicans, according to the Decision Desk/TargetSmart. An additional 4.46 million came from independents who did not vote in 2016. Polls show independents overall breaking toward 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who holds a large polling lead with early voters in key states, while President Donald Trump maintains a significant advantage among those who have yet to vote. \"While early vote turnout has shattered all records, the most meaningful statistic is the number of ballots cast by voters who didn't turn out in 2016,\" TargetSmart CEO Tom Bonier, a veteran Democratic strategist, said. \"These are the voters who will determine how the 2020 electorate differs from Trump's winning coalition in 2016.\" \"These surge voters are younger, more diverse, and more likely to vote Democratic,\" he added. \"That's all a good sign for Joe Biden, at this point, though this electorate continues to be highly dynamic and Republicans are counting on a surge on Election Day.\" More than 26 percent of these new or nonvoters skew younger, between 18-29 years old, with a good chunk coming from the youngest in that group who are voting in their first election. Polling shows that age group is Biden's best demographic and has the highest percentage of voters who said they planned to cast an early ballot. But it's not just young voters. More than 22 percent comes from voters between 50-64 while seniors account for another 20 percent. Democrats are leading with this key demographic in several critical swing states, including Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the Decision Desk/Target Smart. Republicans maintain a slim advantage in Georgia and larger leads in Ohio and Texas. The state with the most eye-opening totals is Pennsylvania — one of the most pivotal states in the 2020 election and where Biden and Trump have duked it out for months. More than 331,000 registered Democrats in the state who did not or could not vote in 2016 have cast ballots so far, compared with just more than 95,000 Republicans. Another 78,000-plus of these voters who are unaffiliated with either party have voted there, too.", "output": "left"}

The online hearing, however, was slowed down by a Big Tech glitch: Twitter CEO Mark Zuckerberg was unable to connect to the hearing, forcing a recess. The hearing initially began with Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker citing Twitter’s and Facebook’s decision to block a story by the New York Post about potentially incriminating contents of three laptops believed to have been owned by Hunter Biden, the son of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. “These recent incidents are only the latest trail of censorship and suppression of conservative voices on the internet,” the Mississippi Republican said. “Reasonable observers are left to wonder whether Big Tech firms are obstructing the flow of information to benefit one political ideology. My concern is that these platforms have become powerful arbiters of what is true and what content users can access the American public gets a little insight into the decision making process content is ideal.” Wicker and other lawmakers want changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to reduce or alter liability protections. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who, along with the other witnesses and lawmakers testified by video, warned eliminating social media’s lawsuit liability protections “will remove free speech from the internet.” Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified that the internet “has been a powerful force of good,” that Google’s services are only possible “because of existing legal frameworks like Section 230.” Pichai said and that Google is “deeply committed to freedom of expression” and warned the committee to be “very aware” on what the changes to the law may mean to businesses and customers. “We recognize people come to our services with [a] broad spectrum of perspective, we approach our work without political bias, full stop,” Pichai testified. Zuckerberg, who was able to quickly resolve the glitch preventing his testimony, delivered an opening statement to lawmakers arguing the government should play a larger role in governing speech on social media platforms. “There are real disagreements about where the limits of online speech should be,” Zuckerberg said. “When a private company is making these calls, we need a more accountable process that people feel is legitimate.” Zuckerberg called on lawmakers to take action. “I believe Congress has a role to play in order to give people confidence that the process is carried out in a way that balances society’s deeply held values appropriately,” Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg called for updating Section 230 with changes, including provisions to “separate good actors from bad actors by making sure that companies can’t hide behind Section 230 to avoid responsibility for intentionally facilitating illegal activity on their platforms.” Zuckerberg said Facebook is willing to work with Congress on changes to the law. “There are consequential choices to be made here,” Zuckerberg said. “And it’s important that we don’t prevent the next generation of ideas form being built.”", "output": "right"}

The weekly average number of new cases reported each day has risen steadily since the first week of October, from about 43,000 to more than 61,000 as of Friday, COVID Tracking Project data shows. The previous record-high weekly average was exactly a month ago, with more than 67,000. The positivity rate in the U.S. has been on the rise since the start of October but still falls far short of the rate during the summer surge, when as much as 8.3% of tests were coming back positive. The soonest a vaccine will be approved by the federal government is the end of this year, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said Friday while warning that “it might be longer.” “I’m cautiously optimistic that by the end of 2020, there will be at least one vaccine that has reached that stage of an emergency use authorization, but I don’t know that for sure — and it might not happen, and it might take longer,” Collins said while speaking to the National Press Club on Friday. Concerns about the safety of such an accelerated timeline could make a significant portion of the population choose not to be inoculated. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said in September that normal, pre-pandemic life may not resume until mid- to late-2021, when an effective COVID-19 vaccine is widely available. If an insufficient proportion of the population gets the vaccine, returning to normal will take much longer. About 51% of people said they would try to get a vaccine when it becomes available, while 45% would not try to get a vaccine, according to recent CNN polling. Trust in the vaccine development process has been falling since the spring. In May, CNN found that 66% said they would try to get a COVID-19 vaccine, and in August, 56% said they would try. To date, nearly 8.5 million cases and more than 223,700 deaths have been confirmed in the U.S. Coronavirus hospitalizations increased in 38 states over the past week and are rising so quickly that healthcare centers in the Midwest are already overwhelmed, according to the Washington Post. France recorded a new daily record for coronavirus infections, with about 42,000 new cases in the past 24 hours, according to data from government health officials on Friday. The rate of new cases reported in France has been climbing since early October, when roughly 12,000 cases were reported each day. French President Emmanuel Macron said at a health center Friday that he expects France will have to live with the virus until at least the summer of 2021, Reuters reported. “When I listen to the scientists and the Scientific Council, we foresee [living with the virus] at best until next summer,” Macron said. “It is still too early to say whether we are moving towards wider local re-confinements, we will try each time to reduce the places, the moments when we have identified that the virus was circulating a lot.” More than 214,000 coronavirus cases have been identified at U.S. colleges this year, the New York Times reported, suggesting that campuses are struggling to contain clusters of new cases. More than 35,000 cases of those cases have been identified since early October. While some colleges that experienced outbreaks early in the school year had to shift to virtual learning entirely, such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, many welcomed students back for on-campus learning. AstraZeneca will resume clinical trials of its vaccine candidate developed with the University of Oxford after pausing the study last month when a volunteer in the United Kingdom developed a neurological illness. The Food and Drug Administration wrapped up investigations into two cases of potential neurological side effects, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. The FDA concluded that the vaccine was not the cause of the cases and told the company that it could resume enrolling volunteers for the clinical trials already in advanced stages. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden tried to leverage one of his strongest moments during the final debate to remind voters President Trump had failed in his COVID-19 response. “We’re more than eight months into this crisis, and the president still doesn’t have a plan. He’s given up. He’s quit on you. He’s quit on your family. He’s quit on America. He just wants us to grow numb and resigned to the horrors of this death toll,” Biden said Friday in Delaware. People who are most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection, including those with Type 2 diabetes and asthma, are likely to work at polling stations on Election Day, according to a new CDC survey of poll workers during the September primary in Delaware. About 32% had an underlying medical condition, and 27% had two or more underlying medical conditions. The survey found that 8.9% of polls workers were diabetic, 23% were obese, 10.9% had asthma, and 32% suffered from hypertension. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said Friday that Trump has not attended a coronavirus task force meeting in several months. Asked by MSNBC’s Chuck Todd when the last time Trump had attended a meeting with the task force, Fauci replied: “At a task force meeting? That was several months ago, Chuck.” Fauci said that Vice President Mike Pence continues to attend meetings regularly and “makes our feelings and what we talk about there known” to Trump. “But direct involvement with the president and discussions?” Fauci continued. “I have not done that in a while.”", "output": "right"}

Given through an IV, remdesivir works to stop replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the drug's manufacturer, California-based Gilead Sciences Inc. Previously authorized by the FDA for emergency use to treat COVID-19, the drug is now the first and only approved COVID-19 treatment in the United States, Gilead said in a release. “Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gilead has worked relentlessly to help find solutions to this global health crisis,” Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day said in a statement. “It is incredible to be in the position today, less than one year since the earliest case reports of the disease now known as COVID-19, of having an FDA-approved treatment in the U.S. that is available for all appropriate patients in need.” The drug cut the time to recovery by five days – from 15 days to 10 on average – in a large study led by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. It had been authorized for use on an emergency basis since spring. President Donald Trump was treated with remdesivir when he was hospitalized with COVID-19 earlier this month. Remdesivir received a guarded endorsement in April from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, when it was announced as a new tool in the fight against the virus at a presidential news conference. The drug also is known by its brand name, Veklury. \"In the United States, Veklury is indicated for adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kilograms) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization,\" Gilead said in the statement. \"Veklury should only be administered in a hospital or in a health care setting capable of providing acute care comparable to inpatient hospital care,\" Gilead said. Gilead’s chief medical officer, Dr. Merdad Parsey, said that “we now have enough knowledge and a growing set of tools to help fight COVID-19.” The drug is either approved or has temporary authorization in about 50 countries, he noted. A large study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 conducted by the World Health Organization recently found that remdesivir had no effect on deaths, the need for ventilation or length of hospital stay, though some have criticized the research.

This means LTCF residents and staff across the country will be able to safely and efficiently get vaccinated once vaccines are available and recommended for them, if they have not been previously vaccinated. It will also minimize the burden on LTCF sites and jurisdictional health departments of vaccine handling, administration, and fulfilling reporting requirements,” HHS said in a press release. HHS said in its press release that the program will be “free of charge to facilities” and be available to residents and staff members in “all long-term care settings, including skilled nursing facilities (SNF), nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes, and adult family homes.” The program will also be available in rural areas where pharmacy access is limited. HHS Secretary Alex Azar called the partnership with the two pharmacies “unprecedented” while announcing the deal. “Protecting the vulnerable has been the number one priority of the Trump Administration’s response to COVID-19, and that commitment will continue through distributing a safe and effective vaccine earliest to those who need it most,” Azar said. “Our unprecedented public-private partnership with CVS and Walgreens will provide convenient and free vaccination to residents of nursing homes across America, another historic achievement in our efforts to get a safe and effective vaccine to Americans as fast as possible.” CNBC reported that the two pharmacies “will schedule and coordinate on-site clinic dates directly with each facility,” anticipating three total visits spread out over two months to administer the two doses of the vaccine to those who need it. Troy Brennan, Chief Medical Officer of CVS Health said the company “has been on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19, working across the health care spectrum in all the communities we serve and that will continue to be the case when we have a vaccine to dispense.” John Standley, Walgreens president said distributing the vaccines to the vulnerable would be “critical” to recovering from COVID-19. “Ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among our most vulnerable populations, will be critical to saving lives and helping our nation recover from the pandemic,” Standley said. “Since the onset of the pandemic, Walgreens has worked closely with the CDC, HHS and the Administration to help accelerate the availability of COVID tests, ensure access to essential medicines and products and serve as a safe and trusted source of information in our communities. We are proud of how our pharmacists have continued to serve our patients and look forward to leveraging our nationwide footprint, community presence and pharmacist expertise to help administer COVID-19 vaccines, once they become available.” On October 19, long-term care facilities will be able to opt-in to the program and declare which pharmacy they will partner with.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The stark differences between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden were on display during their competing town halls on Thursday night, and in no space was that clearer than the magnitude and frequency of their falsehoods. The fact that the second debate was cancelled after Trump backed out of the proposed virtual format deprived Americans of a chance to see the two candidates sparring on the same stage. But where Biden scattered in a small number of exaggerations or misstatements over about an hour and a half, Trump unleashed a barrage of dishonest claims over about an hour. Trump falsely claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 85% of people who wear masks get the coronavirus, again argued inaccurately that there is widespread fraud with mail-in voting, defended as mere “opinion” a baseless conspiracy theory he retweeted about Osama bin Laden and the US military, and repeated familiar false or misleading remarks about the state of the pandemic, Biden’s tax plan, job creation, and his own positions on DACA and pre-existing conditions. Biden falsely claimed that Trump did nothing on unemployment after the initial round of congressional aid expired, wrongly asserted that there are more troops in Afghanistan today than there were when he left the vice presidency, and seemed to incorrectly deny that his website called the Green New Deal a “crucial framework.” CNN’s team watched the dueling townhalls. Here are the facts. Coronavirus Trump: 85% of people who wear masks get the coronavirus Trump made a dramatic claim about Covid-19 during Thursday night’s town hall. “Just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it,” Trump said. It was a repeat of a similar claim he had made two times earlier in the day, citing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the source for that number. Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. A CDC study released in September, did not say that 85% of people who wear masks get infected with the coronavirus. In fact, it did not even attempt to figure out what percentage of people who wear a mask get infected with the coronavirus. Rather, the study looked at the behavior of 154 symptomatic people who had tested positive for the coronavirus in July around the country and 160 people who reported symptoms but tested negative in July. The study found that, of those 154 people, 85% said they had worn a mask either “always” or “often” over the 14 days prior to the onset of their illness. That’s where the 85% figure comes from. Of the 160 people in the study who had tested negative, however, 88.7% said they had worn a mask either “always” or “often.” So there’s really no difference between people who wore masks and those who didn’t. And that’s not even the point here. Trump was suggesting that the CDC found that 85% of all people who wear masks get the coronavirus. But the CDC was just looking at the behavior of these 314 symptomatic people who sought out testing at 11 particular sites around the country in July. Here’s how one of the co-authors, Christopher Lindsell, co-Director of the Health Data Science Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, described the study’s data on masks. “The data suggest that among a group of patients who are already showing symptoms that prompted them to get testing for the virus, there was no statistical evidence of a difference in mask wearing behavior between those who tested positive and those who tested negative,” Lindsell said in an email. “This is very different from the question of whether wearing masks prevents you becoming infected with the virus, and it is also different to the question of how many or what percentage of people who wear masks contract the virus. The study was not designed to answer these questions.” – Daniel Dale Trump: US deaths from Covid will exceed 2 million Trump claimed the US was “expected to lose 2,200,000 people and maybe more than that” from the coronavirus. Facts First: This is misleading. Trump is likely citing a report posted in March by scholars from the Imperial College in London that predicted that a total of 2.2 million Americans could die from Covid-19 if no preventative measures were installed on any level of society. In other words, that would be the loss of lives if no action were taken at all to mitigate it. The report did not analyze what would happen if just the federal government took no action against the virus but rather what would occur if there were absolutely no “control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour.” – Holmes Lybrand and Tara Subramaniam Trump: Biden called him ‘xenophobic’ After an audience member asked a question that mentioned his “travel ban” on China, Trump repeated the assertion that he imposed a “travel ban.” He also claimed that Biden called him “xenophobic and racist” over the policy. Facts First: This is misleading. The phrase “travel ban” is an exaggeration. And although it’s not unreasonable for Trump to claim that Biden accused him of racism, Biden never explicitly linked the racism accusation to the travel restrictions. While Trump did restrict travel from China in early February, he did not put a complete stop to it. His policy made exemptions for travel by US citizens, permanent residents, many of the family members of both groups, and some others. The New York Times reported April 4 that nearly 40,000 people had flown to the US from China since the restrictions went into effect in early February. Biden’s campaign announced in early April that he supports the travel restrictions on China. But his campaign says Biden’s January 31 accusations – that Trump has a record of “hysterical xenophobia” and “fear mongering” – were not about the travel restrictions at all. The campaign says Biden did not know about the restrictions at the time of his speech, since his campaign event in Iowa started shortly after the Trump administration briefing where the restrictions were revealed by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Given the timing of the Biden remarks, it makes sense for the Trump campaign to infer that the former vice president was talking about the travel restrictions. But Biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his April declaration of support. – Daniel Dale Biden: Trump said injecting bleach will combat coronavirus Biden claimed that Trump said injecting bleach could help combat the virus. “President Trump says things like…crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, ‘inject bleach in your arm and that’s going to work,’” Biden said. “I’m being a bit – I’m not being facetious though; he actually said these things.” Facts First: This is misleading. Biden was recalling a moment from a Trump briefing that attracted broad derision. Biden, however, overstated some of the specifics. During an April 23 press briefing, which included a discussion of tests that appeared to show disinfectants like bleach and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces in lab studies, Trump expressed interest in exploring the possibility of “injection inside or almost a cleaning” with disinfectants. Here’s what he said: “(T)hen I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.” – Holmes Lybrand Biden: Covid vaccines haven’t been tested on kids Answering a question about vaccines, Biden talked about the coronavirus’ impact on children. “Children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but we haven’t, there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children,” he said. Facts First: Biden is correct about research in the US, though a leading drugmaker just this week revealed plans to include children in its vaccine research. Pfizer plans to start testing its experimental coronavirus vaccine in children as young as 12, the researcher helping lead the trial told CNN on Tuesday. It will be the first coronavirus vaccine trial to include children in the United States. –Tami Luhby Biden: Redfield said masks would save more lives than a vaccine Biden claimed that Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said wearing a mask would save more lives “between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” Facts First: This goes beyond what Redfield said in congressional testimony. Testifying in September before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, Redfield made headlines for stating, “I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take the Covid vaccine.” But while he said he personally felt more shielded by a mask, he did not say that masks would save more lives than a vaccine. He emphasized the importance of face coverings, saying “facemasks, these face masks, are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.” “I will continue to appeal for all Americans, all individuals in our country, to embrace these face coverings,” Redfield added. “I’ve said it, if we did it for six, 8, 10, 12 weeks, we’d bring this pandemic under control.” You can read more here. – Holmes Lybrand Economy Trump: Biden wants to “quadruple” taxes Trump said: “Our economy is going to be, next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do – it kills everything – our economy is going to be phenomenal next year.” Facts First: This is false. Biden’s plan would increase taxes for people making more than $400,000 per year. He has promised not to directly raise taxes for those making less than that. Higher-income Americans would bear the brunt of the tax hikes proposed by Biden, according to analyses from left-leaning Tax Policy Center, the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Penn Wharton Budget Model. But even the most wealthy Americans would not see their taxes quadruple. For example, the Penn Wharton Budget Model found that the top 0.1% would see an increase of up to 12.4 percentage points on average when including both the individual and the corporate tax changes proposed by Biden. – Katie Lobosco Trump: We set a record on jobs Trump repeated his usual boast about job creation, saying, “We just set a record: 11.4 million jobs.” Facts First: This is misleading. While it’s true that the 11.4 million jobs are a record, Trump left out essential context about the amount of jobs lost during the pandemic. Immediately before this record gain of about 11.4 million jobs over five months, there was a much larger record loss of about 22.2 million jobs over two months. In other words, as of August, the country was still down more than 10.7 million jobs since March. (And as of September, the economy was down about 3.9 million jobs since the beginning of Trump’s presidency.) Also, many of the 11.4 million jobs “added” since May simply represent people returning to their previous jobs, from which they had been temporarily laid off. And the pace of the jobs recovery slowed significantly in September, with 661,000 jobs added – down from about 1.5 million in August. – Daniel Dale Biden: Trump did nothing on unemployment after congressional aid expired Biden slammed Trump for not helping the jobless after the $600 weekly supplement for unemployment benefits – which Congress passed as part of its $2 trillion relief package – lapsed in late July. “And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything,” Biden said. Facts First: This is false. The day after congressional talks to extend the federal boost to unemployment benefits collapsed, Trump signed an executive measure to use $44 billion in federal disaster aid to provide $300 a week to the jobless. The effort provides out-of-work Americans in 49 states and the District of Columbia with these funds for up to six weeks. The money has already been fully distributed in many states. South Dakota declined to participate in the Lost Wages Assistance program. – Tami Luhby The rest Trump: People can decide if Osama bin Laden is alive NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie, who was moderating the Trump town hall, asked about the QAnon-affiliated conspiracy theory Trump had retweeted earlier this week claiming Osama bin Laden was still alive and that the man killed in the raid was a body double. Trump defended his actions, saying, “That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody, and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position.” Facts First: This is a baseless claim with no evidence to back it up. The facts around the killing of bin Laden are not a debatable opinion. In the early morning hours of May 2, 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed by US Special Forces during a raid on his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A DNA test was conducted, confirming it was bin Laden. He was buried at sea. Those are the facts.

He went on to claim that the “thousands of ballots” were found with “my name on it.” Facts First: This is false. There have been two incidents where ballots were found in a dumpster or trash can: 99 ballots heading to voters in New Jersey and nine ballots “incorrectly discarded” by a temporary worker in Pennsylvania. In New Jersey, the Justice Department charged a mail worker with two felonies for tossing 1,875 pieces of mail that included 99 ballots in two dumpsters. The ballots, which were being sent to voters, were immediately delivered after the US Postal Service learned about them being tossed in the trash. This isn’t the first time the President has lied about ballots being found in the trash. He’s repeatedly lied about ballots being found in a trash can in Pennsylvania. According to federal and local authorities, an election worker improperly threw out nine military ballots in Luzerne County. The Justice Department initially said all nine ballots were marked for Trump, then deleted its initial statement and issued a new one saying seven were Trump votes. Local officials said they would try to reach the affected voters and fix the ballots. – Paul Murphy Trump: He’ll protect people with pre-existing conditions Trump reiterated his boast about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. “We’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly,” Trump said. Facts First: This is false. The President has repeatedly asserted his support for covering individuals with pre-existing conditions, yet his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits and protections. In fact, the President is supporting a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican attorneys general that could topple the landmark health reform law and its provisions that ban insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on consumers’ pre-existing conditions. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case on November 10, a week after the election. Trump signed an executive order in September that stated that it’s US policy that people who suffer from pre-existing conditions will be protected. However, this is not actually a plan. – Tara Subramaniam Trump: He’ll ‘take care’ of DACA recipients Trump repeated his claim that the administration is “going to take care” of recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program—the Obama-era program that shields undocumented immigrants who arrived to the US as children from deportation—despite trying to end the program at the start of his presidency. “We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally,” Trump said. “But we are working very hard on the DACA program, and you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year.” Facts First: This is misleading. Trump is responsible for trying to terminate the Obama-era program that shields certain undocumented immigrants from deportation. Despite waffling on the issue publicly, his administration has shown little indication of reversing its position. While the Department of Homeland Security has said it’s reviewing the program following a Supreme Court decision blocking its termination, there’s little indication that Trump is currently working to keep the program in place. Instead, acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf expressed ongoing concerns in a memo released earlier this year, saying: “I have concluded that the DACA policy, at a minimum, presents serious policy concerns that may warrant its full rescission.” Amid that review, the administration has limited renewals to one year instead of two and not accepted new applicants. Immigrant advocates, lawyers and lawmakers have denounced the move, criticizing the delay and arguing the move ran afoul of the Supreme Court’s order. – Priscilla Alvarez Trump: Obama and Biden never tried criminal justice reform Trump, boasting about the First Step Act criminal justice reform bill he signed, repeated a previous claim that Biden and President Barack Obama did not even attempt criminal justice reform during their administration. “Criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it, they never even tried,” he said. Facts First: This is false. The Obama administration did try to get a criminal justice reform bill passed; a bipartisan bill failed in the Senate during the 2016 presidential election, when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided not to bring it up for a vote. The Obama administration nonetheless took its own reform steps that did not require Republican approval, such as banning the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons, working with state and local governments to reduce pre-trial incarceration and the incarceration of people with mental illnesses, and instructing federal prosecutors to try to avoid triggering mandatory minimum sentences for certain non-violent drug offenders. Also, Obama signed a narrower criminal justice bill in 2010, the Fair Sentencing Act, that reduced the disparity between mandatory sentences imposed for crack cocaine offenses and sentences imposed for powder cocaine offenses. And the Obama administration took multiple steps to try to improve policing. You can read more here. – Daniel Dale Trump: He has done more for the Black community than any president but Lincoln Citing his efforts on criminal justice reform, Trump said he has “done more for the African American community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln,” noting that “a lot of people agree.” Facts First: This is false. President Lyndon B. Johnson, for example, signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, monumental bills whose impact dwarfed the impact of any legislation Trump has signed. It’s also worth mentioning that Black people themselves do not, on the whole, agree with Trump’s self-assessment. Trump has had a consistently abysmal approval rating with Black citizens – just 16% among Black likely voters in one recent Quinnipiac University poll, for example, versus 82% disapproval. – Tara Subramaniam Biden: There are more American troops in Afghanistan than when Obama left office Biden claimed that the Trump administration has more people in Afghanistan now than when the Obama administration left office. “You know, you have Americans – bounties on American military’s heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when I left – when we left, in Afghanistan,” Biden said. Facts First: If Biden was speaking strictly about levels of US troops, this is false. In July 2016 President Barack Obama said he would leave 8,400 troops in Afghanistan through the end of his administration. On December 9, 2016 CNN reported there were 9,800 American service members in Afghanistan. While Trump did increase troop levels in Afghanistan earlier in his term, he has since pulled troops out of the country. National security adviser Robert O’Brien said on October 7 there are now fewer than 5,000 US troops in Afghanistan. – Holmes Lybrand Biden: Green New Deal calls for eliminating non-renewable energy by 2030 George Stephanopoulos asked Biden if he was for or against the Green New Deal, noting, “On your website, you call it a crucial framework.” “My deal is a crucial framework, but not the New Green Deal,” Biden responded. “The New Green Deal calls for elimination of all non-renewable energy by 2030. You can’t get there. You’re going to need to be able to transition, George.” Facts First: This is misleading. The Green New Deal does include the goal of hitting net-zero emissions by 2050, but it does not call for the automatic elimination of all non-renewable energy by that date. Biden’s campaign website does call the Green New Deal a “crucial framework” on the environment, but while Biden’s climate plan and the Green New Deal share the overarching goal of curbing heat-trapping gas emissions, the plans differ in how they achieve net-zero emissions – and how quickly they get there. After lauding the “framework” of the Green New Deal, Biden’s website lays out the bullet points of the candidate’s own plan to combat climate change, which includes items like building out energy-efficient infrastructure and setting a goal for the US to reach zero emissions by 2050. While the two plans overlap on some environmental objectives, Biden’s plan does not include many of the social welfare proposals of the Green New Deal. For instance, he is not calling for a guaranteed job for each American with family and medical leave and paid vacations, as the deal proposes. In other ways, the proposals differ less dramatically. Biden’s plan also has a goal of creating a carbon-pollution-free energy sector by 2035, whereas the Green New Deal proposed reaching 100% clean power in 10 years. – Drew Kann This story has been updated.", "output": "left"}

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. What’s worse: no presidential debate at all or separate and unequal events staged at exactly the same time with a media outlet putting both thumbs on the scale to favor one candidate over the other? We will probably find out Thursday night. NBC’s recent decision to stage a town hall with President Donald Trump at the exact time of the already scheduled town hall on ABC with Joe Biden is the latest example of a media organization ignoring the best interests of the voting public in favor of its own. NBC knew ABC had already booked a town hall with Biden starting at 8 p.m. ET, a forum that might have enlightened some viewers on the former vice president’s views. There are plenty of other hours between now and the next actual debate that NBC could have chosen for its own town hall with the President. Instead, it scheduled its event directly against ABC’s, ensuring voters had to deal with conflict instead of illumination. People will now be forced to choose between the town halls based on two factors: preference for a candidate and entertainment value. According to the most recent polls, Biden seems to have the edge on the former, but when did people pass up the chance to see the type of hijinks, aggression or low comedy that only Trump can offer? Will anyone be surprised if Trump draws a bigger crowd than Biden? Consider the entire history of Trump’s political career. He has been all about creating noise, distractions and levels of outrage to play well across the breadth of media. In other words: Trump is treating this as a circus. And let’s face it, at the circus, the guy calmly juggling bowling pins while trying to balance himself on a ball is never going to draw the same crowd as the freak show. Trump really can’t be blamed for doing everything in his bag of pyrotechnic tricks to grab attention, though. He has been down in the polls throughout the campaign and has only been sinking lower of late (not incidentally after his roundly booed debate performance). NBC intends to run the town hall across its multiple networks, including MSNBC and CNBC, which gives Trump wider coverage than Biden will get on ABC alone. Trump, of course, is president largely on the basis of his television appearances, and TV ratings mean a lot to him. He will likely want to create a ratings comparison he can brag about as some evidence of his superiority to Biden, perhaps because the polls are not providing any succor for him in that department. A desperate guy tries desperate ideas. Facing off against Biden in the virtual debate format initially laid out by the debate commission was anathema to Trump, and he told us the reason why: “They cut you off whenever they want.” NBC is offering Trump what he really wanted: a replay of the first debate, at least in terms of a chance to speak on top of whatever Biden is saying without fear of interruption. Offering unchallenged bombast is always his central goal. By having his own dedicated town hall, Trump will get to strut and fret his hour on the stage, sucking up virtually every ounce of oxygen — and attention — the media has to give. NBC’s defense, provided by an NBC News executive who did not want to be named, is that voters are not being disserved because they can and should watch both events through replays of one or the other. It’s the modern age, after all. Linear TV is dead, NBC is arguing — as though that is really what the mass of people are going to do: Record one town hall and watch the other later. Sure. The one thing we know is that Americans rarely pass at the chance to gawk at a traffic accident. That’s what NBC News has set up for them Thursday night — another potential traffic accident. NBC’s justification for inviting Trump on for a town hall is completely legit in one context: The network had already given the same to Biden earlier this month. But permitting Trump to get what he wants — blowing up the real debate because he disliked the format only to create an ersatz one more favorable to him — is embarrassing for NBC. The blowback against NBC’s decision to allow for competing events has been quick and harsh on social media. It will only get worse if Trump is allowed to run roughshod over this event as well, browbeating the moderator, Savannah Guthrie, or any questioners he doesn’t like. He has already expressly insisted on a format where he would not be cut off. NBC has given him everything else he wanted. Will they stand up to him when the bully shows up again?", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Facebook And Twitter Limit Sharing 'New York Post' Story About Joe Biden Updated at 9:14 p.m. ET Facebook and Twitter took action on Wednesday to limit the distribution of New York Post reporting with unconfirmed claims about Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, leading President Trump's campaign and allies to charge the companies with censorship. Both social media companies said the moves were aimed at slowing the spread of potentially false information. But they gave few details about how they reached their decisions, sparking criticism about the lack of clarity and consistency with which they apply their rules. The New York Post published a series of stories on Wednesday citing emails, purportedly sent by Biden's son Hunter, that the news outlet says it got from Trump's private attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Facebook was limiting distribution of the Post's main story while its outside fact-checkers reviewed the claims, spokesman Andy Stone said. That means the platform's algorithms won't place posts linking to the story as highly in people's news feeds, reducing the number of users who see it. However, the story has still been liked, shared or commented on almost 600,000 times on Facebook, according to data from CrowdTangle, a research tool owned by the social network. Stone said Facebook sometimes takes this step if it sees \"signals\" that something gaining traction is false, to give fact-checkers time to evaluate the story before it spreads widely. He did not give more detail on what signals Facebook uses or how often it takes this approach. Twitter went further. It is blocking users from posting pictures of the emails or links to two of the New York Post's stories referring to them, spokesman Trenton Kennedy said, citing its rules against sharing \"content obtained through hacking that contains private information.\" Users who try to share the links on Twitter are shown a notice saying, \"We can't complete this request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful.\" If a user clicks on links already posted on Twitter, the user is taken to a warning screen saying, \"this link may be unsafe,\" which they have to click past to read the story. Twitter also required the New York Post to delete its tweet about the story. Twitter said it decided to block the links because it couldn't be sure about the origins of the emails. It said its policy \"prohibits the use of our service to distribute content obtained without authorization\" and that it doesn't want to encourage hacking by allowing people to share \"possibly illegally obtained materials.\" But the company declined to comment on how it had reached that decision or what evidence it had weighed about the emails in the Post's stories. The company later gave an additional explanation for why it was blocking the stories. Its safety team said in a tweet that the images of emails in the articles \"include personal and private information — like email addresses and phone numbers — which violate our rules\" against unauthorized sharing of such details. CEO Jack Dorsey acknowledged that the company's communication about why it was blocking the articles \"was not great.\" He tweeted that it was \"unacceptable\" to prevent people from sharing \"with zero context as to why we're blocking.\" Asked for comment about the social networks' actions, New York Post spokeswoman Iva Benson referred NPR to an article by the paper's editorial board. \"Our story explains where the info came from, and a Senate committee now confirms it also received the files from the same source,\" the editorial said. \"Yet Facebook and Twitter are deliberately trying to keep its users from reading and deciding for themselves what it means.\" Twitter and Facebook have been acting more aggressively in recent weeks to curb the spread of false claims and manipulation related to the election as part of efforts to avoid a repeat of 2016 when Russian-linked actors used social media to target American voters. Facebook has been warning about the possibility of \"hack and leak\" operations, where stolen documents or other sensitive materials are strategically leaked — as happened in 2016 with hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign. But the companies' moves on Wednesday drew criticism from some experts, who said Facebook and Twitter needed to explain more clearly their policies and how often they apply them. \"This story is a microcosm of something that I think we can expect to happen a lot over the next few weeks and, I think, demonstrates why platforms having clear policies that they are prepared to stick to is really important,\" said Evelyn Douek, a Harvard Law School lecturer who studies the regulation of online speech. \"It's really unclear if they have stepped in exceptionally in this case and, if they have, why they've done so,\" she said. \"That inevitably leads to exactly the kind of outcry that we've seen, which is that they're doing it for political reasons and because they're biased.\" Republicans seized on the episode as proof of their long-running assertions that the social networks censor conservative voices. There is no statistical evidence to support those claims. Trump tweeted that it was \"[s]o terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story,\" although Facebook did not remove it from its platform. \"REPEAL SECTION 230!!!\" he wrote, referring to a long-standing legal shield that protects online platforms from being sued over what people post on them and says they can't be punished for reasonable moderation of those posts. Trump has repeatedly called for Section 230 to be revoked. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sent letters to the CEOs of both Facebook and Twitter on Wednesday pressing them on the decisions to reduce distribution and block the story. Hawley also sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission saying the companies' actions possibly constituted \"egregious campaign-finance violations benefitting the Biden campaign.\" The Senate Republican Conference, which is led by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., tweeted, \"see you soon, @jack,\" with an image of the Post's story. Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, is scheduled to testify, along with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, before the Senate Commerce Committee on Oct. 28 — six days before the election.

The president’s town hall, which was announced on Wednesday morning, will take place on NBC News in Miami, Florida, and it will be moderated by Savannah Guthrie on Thursday night. Simultaneously, the former vice president will be on ABC News with George Stephanopoulos in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of the hurdles that the Trump campaign had to overcome to solidify the town hall on NBC News had to do with the president’s health following his bout with the coronavirus. A press release from the network stated that Dr. Clifford Lane, the clinical director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci reviewed the president’s PCR test on Oct. 13 and concluded “with a high degree of confidence” that the president is “not shedding infectious virus.” The choice of network for the president’s town hall is notable given it’s not Fox News, his usual port of call for media appearances. The presidential debate was canceled last week after the debate commission opted to change the town hall style debate to a virtual one, given Trump’s coronavirus diagnosis. The president rebuffed the idea, saying he wasn’t going to “waste my time” in a virtual debate, and his campaign accused the commission of switching the format to help the vice president. The president’s campaign then offered to push the debate event back a week, which would also result in delaying the third debate a week, but the Biden campaign refused that offer.

(AP) — A late-stage study of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate has been paused while the company investigates whether a study participant’s “unexplained illness” is related to the shot. The company said in a statement Monday evening that illnesses, accidents and other so-called adverse events “are an expected part of any clinical study, especially large studies,” but that its physicians and a safety monitoring panel would try to determine what might have caused the illness. The pause is at least the second such hold to occur among several vaccines that have reached large-scale final tests in the U.S. The company declined to reveal any more details about the illness, citing the participant’s privacy. Temporary stoppages of large medical studies are relatively common. Few are made public in typical drug trials, but the work to make a coronavirus vaccine has raised the stakes on these kinds of complications. Companies are required to investigate any serious or unexpected reaction that occurs during drug testing. Given that such tests are done on tens of thousands of people, some medical problems are a coincidence. In fact, one of the first steps the company said it will take is to determine if the person received the vaccine or a placebo. The halt was first reported by the health news site STAT. Final-stage testing of a vaccine made by AstraZeneca and Oxford University remains on hold in the U.S. as officials examine whether an illness in its trial poses a safety risk. That trial was stopped when a woman developed severe neurological symptoms consistent with transverse myelitis, a rare inflammation of the spinal cord, the company has said. That company’s testing has restarted elsewhere. Johnson & Johnson was aiming to enroll 60,000 volunteers to prove if its single-dose approach is safe and protects against the coronavirus.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The FBI announced Thursday that investigators had thwarted a plot by a right-wing militant group to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer at her vacation home before the Nov. 3 election. The affidavit, filed under seal in federal court on Tuesday but unsealed on Thursday, names six men — Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta — to be charged over the kidnapping plot. The men were arrested on Wednesday. \"Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin' Governor. Just grab the bitch,\" Fox allegedly told the others. \"Because at that point, we do that, dude — it's over.\" At a press conference Thursday, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel also announced that state prosecutors have filed charges against seven additional men known to be members or associates of the militia group Wolverine Watchmen under the Michigan Anti-Terrorism Act. These men allegedly wanted to target law enforcement officers in their homes, made threats of violence intended to start a civil war, and were planning an attack on the state's capitol building that involved kidnapping government officials, including Whitmer. They have also been arrested. “I knew this job would be hard, but I’ll be honest — I never could have imagined anything like this,” Whitmer said during a press conference Thursday afternoon as she thanked federal and state partners for foiling the plans of 13 members of the two militia groups, whom she described as “sick and depraved men.” Their meetings and trainings came as President Donald Trump and his supporters intentionally muddied the waters about — and, in some cases, riled the nation against — science-based guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, such as closing gyms. The far right portrayed those who didn't adhere to the guidelines as patriots, and those who did as being against personal liberty. Trump has in the past embraced violent far-right groups who oppose the racial justice movement and coronavirus lockdowns. “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” he tweeted in April. Last week, during the presidential debate, Trump told the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group known for instigating violence, “to stand back and stand by,” when he was asked to condemn white supremacists and militia groups. During her remarks, Whitmer said the president's comments were a refusal to denounce white supremacists and “hate groups like these two Michigan militia groups.” The Michigan governor in part blamed Trump's rhetoric for the groups’ actions. “When our leaders speak, their words matter. They carry weight,” she said. “When our leaders meet with, encourage, or fraternize with domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions, and they are complicit. When they stoke and contribute to hate speech, they are complicit.” On Thursday, Joe Biden echoed Whitmer's statements, telling reporters, \"The words he utters matters.\" Biden said he thinks Trump's \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN\" tweet encouraged militias. “Why won’t the president just say ‘Stop, stop, stop, stop — and we will pursue you if you don’t'?\" the Democratic nominee said. Whitmer, a Democrat, implemented a wide range of shutdown methods when the coronavirus pandemic was declared and Detroit quickly became a hot spot for the virus. The state then saw drive-by protests and armed right-wing demonstrators occupy the state capitol building over the lockdowns. “All of us in Michigan can disagree about politics, but those disagreements should never ever amount to violence,” US Attorney Matthew Schneider said during a joint press conference announcing the operation. According to the charging papers, the FBI first became aware of the Whitmer kidnap plot in early 2020 over social media, where agents discovered a group of men, including Croft and Fox, discussing \"the violent overthrow of certain government and law-enforcement components.\" They planned to get others to join them. On June 6, approximately 15 people gathered in Ohio, where they spoke about state governments they believed were violating the Constitution. They specifically named Michigan and Whitmer. “Several members talked about murdering ‘tyrants’ or ‘taking’ a sitting governor,” reads the affidavit. Shortly after, on June 14, Fox spoke on the phone with one of the FBI’s confidential sources and told them he needed “200 men” for his plan “to storm the Capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, and take hostages, including the Governor.” Fox said Whitmer would be tried for “treason,” and that the plan would take place before the 2020 presidential election on Nov. 3. Six days later, a group of people, including Fox and Garbin, met at Fox’s business in Grand Rapids to discuss their plans. The meeting took place in the basement of a shop, which, according to the court documents, “was accessed through a trap door hidden under a rug on the main floor.” Fox had collected cellphones of attendees before they went through the hidden trap door, but one of the FBI’s sources wore a recording device and captured audio of them discussing the use of “Molotov cocktails” to destroy police vehicles during the planned assault on the state capitol. Fox also complained specifically about the state’s closure of gyms because of the coronavirus pandemic, calling Whitmer “this tyrant bitch” in a livestreamed video to a private Facebook group on June 25. In a phone conversation on July 24 recorded by an unnamed confidential informant and given to the FBI, Fox allegedly talked with the informant and Garbin about how tyrannical the government had become. Fox was recorded on the call saying: “In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I’m not even fuckin’ kidding. I just wanna make it all glow, dude. I don’t fuckin’ care anymore, I’m just so sick of it. That’s what it’s gonna take for us to take it back, we’re just gonna have to — everything’s gonna have to be annihilated, man. The men would meet regularly in rural Michigan “where they engage in firearms training and tactical drills.” Over the weekend of July 10–12, five of the charged men, along with others, did firearms training and attempted to build two improvised explosive devices, using “black powder, balloons, a fuse, and BBs for shrapnel.” However, the IEDs didn’t explode. “The construction of the devices was faulty, and they did not detonate as planned,” the charging documents state. Explosive devices were referred to in code as “cake” and “cupcake,” and a mention of a “baker” was understood by one of the confidential sources to be an explosives manufacturer. The discussion to attack Whitmer’s vacation home seemed to begin over several days in July, according to court documents. Garbin discussed shooting up the governor’s vacation home. Fox said they should abduct her as she either arrived or left either her personal vacation home or her official summer residence and suggested destroying her boat. On July 27, Fox texted a group chat that included three of the other charged men, “OK, well how’s everyone feel about kidnapping?” In late August, Fox and two others drove past Whitmer’s vacation home, taking photographs and videos and made plans for further surveillance by boat. On the weekend of Sep. 12–13, the six charged men, along with an FBI informant and an undercover agent, met up again just an hour and a half drive from the vacation home. Croft detonated an IED he made from a firework. Croft and Fox discussed plans to detonate a bridge near her home to distract the police, and the group joked about how they were “adult napping” not “kidnapping.” “Kidnapping, arson, death. I don’t care,” Franks allegedly said. Four of the charged men planned to meet on Oct. 7 to pay $4,000 for explosives for the bridge and exchange equipment. Instead, the men were arrested. For their investigation, the FBI relied on undercover agents, confidential informants, and recordings of meetings, phone calls, and group chats. The affidavit notes that the FBI paid one of the confidential informants approximately $8,600 for expenses related to the investigation. The alleged domestic terrorist group had already been brought to the attention of the FBI by a local police department after members of the group tried to get home addresses of officers, and a source from the group told the FBI about its plans “to target and kill police officers.” The men would meet regularly in rural Michigan “where they engage in firearms training and tactical drills.\" Fox, whom the charging documents indicate was the ringleader and instigator of the plot to kidnap Whitmer, was a member of at least two public Facebook “militia” groups: “Militia Wanted Michigan” and “Michigan Home Guard.” Although Fox’s profile and the groups’ pages have been removed from the website, cached versions of these sites show that he regularly posted and participated in discussions with other members over the past year. On June 23, he posted in the “Militia Wanted Michigan” group that he had created another (now-deleted) Facebook group called “Michigan Patriot III%ERS.” The “Three Percenters” are a far-right militia group with chapters across the country, named for the false historical claim that only 3% of Americans fought against the British in the Revolutionary War. Fox’s Twitter account reveals his support for Trump and seven years of deep-seated hostility toward prominent members of the Democratic Party, such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Nancy Pelosi. Caserta was one of the most active members of the group on social media. The day before his arrest he posted two TikTok videos. “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, and indifference to this notion is the means by which the people can and will secure their own oppression,\" he said in one of the videos. \"Wake the fuck up.\" On his Facebook account, which has since been deleted, Caserta posted a message the day before his arrest, saying, \"Is it morally legitimate to initiate violence and theft against non violent people?\" He also posted images in support of the Kenosha, Wisconsin, shooter Kyle Rittenhouse, shared messages opposing vaccination, and spouted misogynist views. State officials said more than 200 state and federal law enforcement officers were involved in the investigation, and that search warrants were executed in more than a dozen cities around the state. “There has been a disturbing increase in anti-government rhetoric and the re-emergence of groups that embrace extremist ideologies,\" Nessel said in a statement. “These groups often seek to recruit new members by seizing on a moment of civil unrest and using it to advance their agenda of self-reliance and armed resistance.\" As part of the investigation, Nessel said, state officials filed a total of 19 felony charges against seven men — Paul Bellar, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, Pete Musico, and Joseph Morrison. The charges under the state’s anti-terrorism laws include gang membership, threat of terrorism, providing material support for terrorist acts, and carrying or possessing a firearm during the commission of a felony. “The nature of this case is rather unprecedented, but it does send a very vivid reminder that while we may be in a time period of discourse, possibly even divisiveness and fighting across the nation, law enforcement stands united,” Col. Joseph Gasper, director of the Michigan State Police, said. “We will take swift action against anyone who is planning or seeking to commit harm to anyone in the state of Michigan.” Correction: Kyle Rittenhouse was charged in connection with fatal shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Kamala Harris will face off on Wednesday for the first and only vice presidential debate during the 2020 campaign. But if history is any guide and people continue to vote the top of the ticket, the debate won’t change much. An analysis published by Gallup in 2012 declared that the median change following vice presidential debates in 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2008 was 1 percentage point. “None of the eight vice presidential debates occurring from 1976 to 2008 appears to have meaningfully altered voter preferences,” analyst Andrew Dugan wrote at the time. “There is very little evidence that vice presidential debates do much at all to alter the political landscape,” wrote University of Wisconsin professor Thomas Holbrook in his 1996 book, Do Campaigns Matter? Polling also changed little in 2012 after the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and former House Speaker Paul Ryan. In the days after the 2016 debate between Pence and Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Donald Trump grew by a few points. But it was also only three days after the debate when the “Access Hollywood tape” was released, showing Trump making extraordinarily lewd comments. Nevertheless, the advanced age of the two presidential candidates adds a new focus this year: Trump, 74, was recently hospitalized with the coronavirus, and Biden will turn 78 years old in November. In 2016, a record 84 million people watched Trump and Clinton go head-to-head, making it the most-watched debate in U.S. history, counting millions more than the 1980 debate between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, which was the previous record-holder. By contrast, the debate between Pence and Kaine drew 37 million viewers, the smallest audience for a vice presidential debate since 2000. The only vice presidential debate in the last 44 years to draw a television audience larger than the presidential debate was between Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, selected as Sen. John McCain’s running mate, and Biden, with Palin memorably asking, “Hey, can I call you Joe?” According to a new Harris Poll survey, voters are paying close attention this year to the bottom half of the ticket. Among the sample of 1,976 adults polled between Oct. 1-3, 69% said they will factor Trump and Biden’s vice presidential picks into their Election Day vote. Voters say they are hoping for substance after last week’s chaotic 90-minute showdown — nearly half say they expect more focus on the issues at stake than they heard from Trump and Biden.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "WASHINGTON — Amid the constant political chaos of 2020, there have been a few consistencies. One of them has been a growing Democratic advantage in this fall’s congressional races, particularly the Senate. For Democrats, the potential for pickups is growing and affecting some places where a tight general election race is not a normal occurrence. From the Mountain West to the South, the list of competitive Senate races for the GOP looks different this year. Going into this election cycle Republicans knew they were going to be defending a challenging map. There are 23 Republican seats on the ballot this fall and only 12 for the Democrats. But aside from those differences, the changes in battlegrounds since the beginning of the year have been remarkably one-sided. In January — when the Cook Political Report released its first race ratings for the year — it showed three Republican seats that were rated “Toss Up” or worse, while Democrats had one seat that was “Toss Up” or worse. In that list of ratings, Republican seats in Arizona, Colorado and Maine were listed as “Toss Ups.” In addition, the GOP had seats in Kansas and North Carolina that were listed as “Lean Republican.” For the Democrats, their seat in Alabama was listed as a “Toss Up.” They had one additional seat in Michigan listed as “Lean Democratic.” The battleground races largely made sense. The Republican “Toss Up” states, Colorado and Maine, went to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. And Arizona’s other Senate seat had just flipped Democratic in 2018. In the GOP’s “Lean” seats, North Carolina’s statewide contests have been close for the past several cycles. And Kansas looked like a bit of an outlier, but the state had just elected a Democratic governor. For the Democrats, it made sense that Alabama was at least a “Toss Up” since the state is usually solidly Republican. Democratic Sen. Doug Jones won his race against a deeply flawed candidate in Roy Moore. And Michigan, the home of the Democratic “Lean” seat, voted for Donald Trump in 2016. But the latest Cook ratings now show a different landscape. For the Republicans, seven Senate seats are highly competitive, rated “Toss Up” or worse, and still only one Democratic seat falls into that category. For the Democrats, the only difference is the Alabama seat has moved to “Lean Republican.” The Democrats “Lean” seat in Michigan remains in the same category. For the Republicans, however, the changes are more dramatic. The Colorado and Arizona seats have moved from “Toss Up” to “Lean Democratic.” And there are now five GOP “Toss Up” seats including those in Iowa, Georgia, Montana and North Carolina — all states won by Trump in 2016 — along with Maine. In addition, there are three “Lean Republican” seats, including the other Georgia seat, Kansas and South Carolina. Trump won all those states by 5 points or more in 2016. And a few of those new Republican “Lean” states stand out for being battlegrounds. Consider South Carolina and Kansas. In some ways, Sen. Lindsey Graham’s seat in South Carolina tells the most dramatic story for 2020. It has moved a long way since January in the Cook ratings. Back then the seat was listed as “Solid Republican,” in part because Graham seemed to be working hard to win over Trump voters. The president won the state by 14 points in 2016 and no Democrat had won a Senate seat in the state for 15 years. But the numbers show much less support for Graham recently. A late-September poll from Quinnipiac University found the race dead even and every poll since September has it in single-digits. Furthermore, Graham’s opponent, Jaime Harrison, is flooding the airwaves with campaign ads, and is set to outspend Graham 7 to 1 in the last month of the election. The close race for the open Kansas seat may tell a longer story of change. It has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1939 and the 20-point win the state gave Trump in 2016 was largely in line with other recent GOP presidential wins there. But when Kansas elected a Democratic governor in 2018, the results felt like pushback against the previous eight years of Republican rule. That time brought large-scale tax cuts and program cuts to the state — including heavy cuts to schools. And now the latest polls in the state suggest the race is close. One survey from a Republican firm found the Republican, Roger Marshall, leading by about 4 points. A survey from a Democratic firm found the Democrat, Barbara Bollier, leading by 2. Both polls had Marshall at 43 percent, which is not where a Republican wants to be in Kansas, especially not a month out from Election Day. The presidential race has dominated the news this past week — and really the entire cycle. Years with presidential races tend to be that way and Trump has only heightened the effect. But the Senate ratings shift serve as a reminder that there is more at stake in November than just the White House. And the last few months have shown a decided Democratic tilt on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, some of it coming from places we don’t usually expect.", "output": "left"}

The American Investment Council PAC has donated more than $243,000 to candidates in both the House and Senate since 2018, according to an Axios analysis of FEC records, and 65% of those funds were sent to Republican candidates. Some of the senators who received funding from the PAC include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Eight of the nine Senate candidates that the group contributed to were Republicans, while 22 of the 38 House candidates who received money were Democrats. The group, whose members include leading private equity and growth capital firms, does not donate to the campaigns of presidential candidates. A spokesperson for the AIC PAC told Fox News that the group contributes to elected officials from both sides of the aisle who \"support legislation and policies that will encourage more private investment across the country.” Private equity groups tend to favor Republican candidates, who are seen as having more favorable tax and regulatory policies for business. Among the PAC’s stated priorities, for example, is “opposition” to policies that would tax carried interest capital gains as ordinary income. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has proposed taxing capital gains at ordinary income rates, and Democrats have discussed eliminating the carried interest loophole. Biden has also advocated for raising the corporate tax rate to 28%, from the current rate of 21%.", "output": "right"}

The officers, executing a narcotics warrant, told investigators they knocked and announced themselves before using a battering ram to bash the door to Breonna Taylor’s South End apartment off its hinges that chaotic March night. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker III, and his lawyer have maintained that he didn’t know who was entering the Springfield Drive apartment and that he fired once. Kentucky’s top prosecutor said Walker’s round hit one of the officers, Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, in the leg. The officers unleashed a 32-round hail of return fire that killed Taylor and set off months of unrest in Louisville and other US cities. A Kentucky grand jury last week did not indict any of the three officers directly involved in the raid on charges connected with Taylor’s death. One officer faces charges for firing into an adjacent occupied apartment. Mattingly and Det. Myles Cosgrove were not charged. Former Det. Brett Hankison was indicted on three counts of wanton endangerment in the first degree for allegedly firing blindly into Taylor’s apartment. He has pleaded not guilty. Audio from the secret grand jury proceedings released on Friday offers a glimpse into the confusion that reigned during the final moments of Taylor’s life. Here are some highlights from the nearly 15 hours of recordings: No official plan. No drugs. Det. Herman Hall, an investigator with the state attorney general’s office, told the grand jury he knew of no official plan for the officers in the botched raid. A juror said Mattingly told investigators that officers had a formal plan, with specific roles, for executing a number of search warrants that night. The juror asked if anyone had seen a formal plan that would back up Mattingly’s account. “No ma’am,” Hall replied. “I haven’t seen it.” Hall told the panel the “only plan I have seen” was a whiteboard with addresses of locations to be raided and the names of officers involved in each. Jurors can be heard murmuring that they had not seen the whiteboard. A photo of the board was shown to them. Hall pointed out that the address listed for Taylor was incorrect. “Were drugs, money or paraphernalia recovered?” said Hall, repeating a question from a panel member. “The answer to that is no. They did not go forward with executing the initial search warrant that they had for Breonna Taylor’s apartment.” Another officer, Det. Michael Nobles, told the grand jury on September 21 that police believed Taylor was home with a small child. “That’s why we decided to knock – it was a no-knock warrant – but we wanted to give her time to, you know, warn the kids,” Nobles said. Mattingly told investigators officers believed Taylor was “probably there alone.” Hankison, in a recording played for the grand jury, told investigators that he wasn’t supposed to work that night. He was not even part of the drug investigation. Hankison handles a narcotics detection dog. He told investigators he volunteered for the assignment. The dog was left in a patrol car during the start of the raid. The officers at Taylor’s apartment that night were a “hodgepodge of people thrown together” – who were not connected to the drug investigation, Hankison told investigators. The officers were briefed minimally on the location about two hours before the raid, he said. It was considered a soft target and Taylor was not considered a threat. “We were all kind of the older guys who were put with it because this was going to be the easy location,” said Hankison, who is 44. Officers say they knocked, announced presence “Banged on the door. No response. Banged on it again. No response.” That’s what Mattingly, in a recorded interview in March that was played for the grand jury, said happened in the first moments of the raid. “At that point we started announcing ourselves,” Mattingly said. Mattingly told investigators that “our intent was not to hit the door.” The officers, though, had a no-knock search warrant that would have allowed them to enter without announcing themselves as law enforcement. “Our intent was to give her plenty of time to come to get to the door,” he said. Nobles told investigators that he knocked on the door and announced police for one to two minutes. He said one officer could hear movement inside. After banging on the door six or seven times, Mattingly said, the decision was made to enter by force. A battering ram was used. Mattingly said it took three strikes to knock the door off its hinges. Walker, Taylor’s boyfriend, told investigators he never heard anyone say “police” and that his and Taylor’s shouts of “Who is it?” were met with silence, according to a CNN review of audio recordings of official statements in the case in July. CNN interviewed several of Taylor’s neighbors, either directly or through their attorney. Most said they were awakened by the gunfire and therefore did not hear what preceded it. Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said one witness told investigators the officers had announced themselves. “She’s yelling at the top of her lungs — and I am too at this point — who is it?” Walker told investigators, according to the CNN review. “No answer. No response. No anything.” As Walker and Taylor made their way down a hallway toward the front door, he said, the door flew off its hinges. “So I just let off one shot,” he told investigators. “I still can’t see who it is or anything.” ‘I’ve been hit!’ wounded officer says “Police. Search Warrant. Police. Search Warrant.” Those were the words that Mattingly said officers yelled when they broke into the apartment, according to a recording of his interview with investigators that was played before the grand jury. Mattingly was the first to lean inside. It was dark. About 20 feet away the officer said he made out a man and a woman. Mattingly told investigators the man stood in a “stretched-out position with his hand on a gun, and as soon as I clear (the doorway), he fires a gun.” “As soon as the shot hit, I could feel the heat in my leg. So I returned fire,” he added. “I’ve been hit!” Lt. Shawn Hoover recalled Mattingly saying, according to a recording of his March interview with investigators. Colleagues dragged Mattingly, wounded and bleeding heavily from his thigh, out to a parking lot and used a belt as a tourniquet, Hoover said. ‘Dark, deep black and vivid white flashes’ Moments after Mattingly stepped into the apartment, Cosgrove told investigators, he saw “blinding, vivid, white light and I see blackness at the same time. Just dark, deep black and vivid white flashes.” For a moment he could not hear. “Everything was completely muted,” Cosgrove said. “There was no sound.” He added, “I am positive that I had fired or was firing during those flashes, during that vivid white and black … colors I was seeing.” Cosgrove told investigators he did not know how many times he pulled the trigger. Cameron told reporters that Cosgrove fired 16 rounds that night. CNN has reached out to Cosgrove’s attorney for comment. The detective was one of three officers who fired their weapons. FBI ballistic tests determined a bullet from Cosgrove’s gun killed Taylor, according to the attorney general. Cameron said Mattingly and Cosgrove’s shots were justified because Taylor’s boyfriend fired at officers first. Mattingly’s attorney Kent J. Wicker in a recent statement called Taylor’s death a tragedy. “But these officers did not act in a reckless or unprofessional manner,” Wicker said. “They did their duty, performed their roles as law enforcement officers and, above all, did not break the law.” Hankison allegedly blindly fired 10 rounds into Taylor’s apartment through a covered patio door and window that prevented him from assessing any threat posed by the occupants before opening fire, according to authorities. Some rounds penetrated a neighboring apartment and endangered the lives of three occupants, according to the attorney general. Stewart Matthews, an attorney for Hankison, told CNN on Friday that he hadn’t received copies of the grand jury recordings but hadn’t heard any “surprises” on news reports. CNN again sought comment from Matthews on Saturday. Hankison, in the recording played for the grand jury, sounded emotional when he talked about Mattingly getting shot. “All I could hear was the firing. I saw the flashing,” he said. Hankison believed his colleagues were “being executed” as they rushed in to help the wounded officer. The gunfire intensified. Hankison said he believed the officers were “all getting sprayed with bullets.” “My only option was to return fire and I did that to the muzzle flashes,” Hankison told investigators in the interview played for the grand jury. “And I want to be specific about this. I had already seen where the threat was. I saw where he was positioned in the hallway.” Hankison repeated several times that he saw a large figure – in a military stance and holding what he believed was an AR-15-style rifle – at the end of the apartment hallway. His colleagues were “sitting ducks,” he said. Walker dialed 911 on his cell phone. He sounded distraught and told the dispatcher someone had kicked in the door and shot his girlfriend. The dispatcher peppered him with questions. Walker moaned his girlfriend’s nickname — “Bre” — over and over. “Help,” he pleaded. In the apartment, Walker was found unharmed. Walker told officers at the scene that Taylor had opened fire on them, according to the Hankison’s account to investigators. Walker’s attorney, Steve Romines, told CNN that Walker initially told officers that Taylor fired at them because he feared for his life. Romines said his client later admitted to firing a shot when he was interviewed at a police station. Officers found Taylor on the ground beside Walker, bleeding profusely. There were bullet holes everywhere, including in a neighboring apartment where a young child lived, according to CNN’s review of the case in July. Taylor had five gunshot wounds, an investigator for the attorney general told the grand jury. One to the left upper breast killed her.

Mr Trump, who is still contagious, removed his mask on the balcony of the White House, while posing for pictures. His physician said he would continue treatment from there, and he \"may not entirely be out of the woods yet\". Several of Mr Trump's staff and aides have also tested positive for the virus in recent days. Questions remain over the seriousness of Mr Trump's illness after a weekend of conflicting statements. On Tuesday, his first morning back in the White House, the president took to Twitter to compare Covid-19 to the flu. \"Flu season is coming up!\" he wrote. \"Are we going to close down our Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid.\" The US remains the country worst-hit by Covid-19, with 210,000 deaths and 7.4 million cases. Between 1 October 2019 and 4 April 2020, the flu caused between 24,000 and 62,000 deaths in the US, according to government figures. Mr Trump's diagnosis has upended his campaign for a second term in office, less than a month before the Republican president faces Democratic challenger Joe Biden in the presidential election. What happened during Trump's return? Wearing a navy business suit, tie and mask, Mr Trump walked out of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in the Washington DC suburbs on Monday evening pumping his fist. After a short helicopter ride, Mr Trump was pictured alone on the Truman Balcony of the White House. He removed his protective face mask, before giving a thumbs-up and a military-style salute. A couple of hours later, he tweeted a campaign-style clip of his return set to stirring music. Allow X content? Mr Trump also recorded a video message, urging Americans to get back to work. \"You're going to beat it [coronavirus],\" he told them, adding: \"We're going to be out front. As your leader, I had to do that. I knew there's danger to it, but I had to do it. I stood out front, and led.\" Mr Trump also speculated: \"Now I'm better, maybe I'm immune, I don't know\". The World Health Organization says it is too early to know if people who have recovered from Covid-19 are protected from a second infection, and if so, how long this protection might last. The president's own medical team does not consider him to be fully recovered yet. Mr Trump also promised that vaccines were \"coming momentarily\", although the US Centers for Disease Control has said no vaccine is expected to be widely available before the middle of next year. Allow X content? Before leaving hospital, the president told Americans in a tweet not to fear the disease and said he would be back on the campaign trail \"soon\". Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he was \"glad\" the president appeared to be \"coming along pretty well\". But he criticised Mr Trump, saying: \"Anybody who contracts the virus by essentially saying masks don't matter, social distancing doesn't matter, I think is responsible for what happens to them.\" According to US public health guidelines, Mr Trump should remain in isolation for up to 10 days after symptoms first appear. The White House says the president first started to appear ill on Thursday evening, and later tested positive. An almost messianic message Donald Trump says he has overcome the coronavirus - and you can, too. In his video message from the White House, a mask-less Trump tells the American public: \"Don't be afraid of it. You're going to beat it.\" And so the president's message in the final weeks of his re-election campaign takes shape. He contracted the coronavirus because he was an out-front leader and he \"had to do that\". \"Nobody that's a leader would not do what I did,\" he said. It is a message almost messianic in its undertones - one that the rest of his party is amplifying. The president has suffered and overcome, and will lead the nation to a promised land beyond the virus. New York Post columnist Miranda Devine, quote-tweeted by the president, said Mr Trump would return to the campaign trail as an \"invincible hero\". Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler tweeted out a video of Mr Trump tackling a virus-headed antagonist. There is political and personal risk for the president, of course. He could experience a relapse or long-term medical difficulties. Americans who have lost loved ones to the disease may find his words and actions ill-considered or offensive. The president, however, seems determined to turn his recent weakness into a strength. What did Trump's doctors say? His physician Sean Conley said on Monday afternoon that the president, whose oxygen levels dipped twice over the weekend, would be \"surrounded by world-class medical care 24/7\" at the White House. He refused to answer questions about when Mr Trump last received a negative test or to go into the specifics of his treatment. He would not offer details regarding the president's scans to check for pneumonia, citing patient protection laws. He did confirm Mr Trump is still on the steroid dexamethasone and has received three doses of antiviral drug remdesivir. He was to receive another before discharge and a fifth at the White House. When asked about whether Mr Trump was safe to travel for campaign events, Dr Conley said: \"We'll see.\" \"If we can get through to [next] Monday with him remaining the same or improving, better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief,\" he added. What the doctors will be looking out for Considering we're told President Trump tested positive on Thursday, he seems to be making great progress - especially as he is a high risk patient, being 74, a man, overweight and living with a heart condition. He's received a cocktail of drugs normally reserved for the sickest of Covid patients who have been ill for weeks, not days, to aid and hasten his recovery. It's not clear when Mr Trump caught the virus or first started to feel unwell. Most people who develop symptoms do so on around day five. Some people have only mild symptoms that clear up after a week or so with some bed rest. A turning point can be around seven days later, with some patients getting a more serious lung infection from the virus. These patients need to be in hospital because they can deteriorate quickly and need expert care. The body can go into overdrive fighting the virus, leading to respiratory failure, septic shock and multiple organ damage. Mr Trump's doctors say they remain cautiously optimistic about the president's health but \"on guard\" for at least the coming week should things take a turn for the worse. What's the latest with the White House outbreak? The president's discharge comes as more new cases have been reported among White House staff. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany became the latest high-profile figure close to the president to confirm a positive test earlier on Monday. US media said two other aides to the press secretary had had positive results. Ms McEnany was seen speaking to journalists without wearing a mask on Sunday but said no members of the press had been listed as close contacts by the White House medical unit. First Lady Melania Trump, senior aides and several Republican senators have also tested positive. Mrs Trump, who is 50, has been isolating at the White House, reportedly with mild symptoms. In a tweet she said: \"I am feeling good [and] will continue to rest at home\". At least 12 people close to Mr Trump have now tested positive, as have several junior staff members. Many of those attended a gathering at the White House Rose Garden on 26 September that is being scrutinised as a possible \"super-spreader event\". Among them is former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who said on Saturday he had checked himself into hospital because he is asthmatic, a known high-risk factor. The latest coronavirus case to emerge from that event, at which the president unveiled his nominee for the US Supreme Court, is a Christian minister from California. Pastor Greg Laurie, who is said to have mild symptoms, was also with US Vice-President Mike Pence earlier in that day at a prayer march in central Washington DC. Plexiglass will be used to separate Vice-President Mike Pence and Democratic challenger Kamala Harris and limit the risk of Covid transmission when they go head-to-head in a debate in Salt Lake city, Utah, on Wednesday. Both candidates have recently tested negative.", "output": "center"}

Dr. Sean Conley said Trump has experienced two episodes of transient drops in oxygen levels. From Thursday into Friday morning, Conley said Trump was doing well with mild symptoms and oxygen levels in the high 90s. By later Friday morning, the president had a high fever and his oxygen levels began dipping below 94%. At that point, Conley recommended supplemental oxygen treatment due to concerns about the possible rapid progression of the disease. Trump was adamant he did not need the treatment, but it was nevertheless administered for about an hour at the White House. He began showing milder symptoms and began moving about his residence at the White House, but, despite these improvements, Conley said the medical team determined the best course of action was to transfer Trump to Walter Reed in Bethesda, Md., by Friday afternoon for a more thorough evaluation and monitoring. Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist at Walter Reed, said the president has remained without a fever since Friday morning and his cardiac, kidney and liver functions are all still normal. He said Trump has not shown signs of shortness of breath and was walking around his medical unit without limitation or disability. TRUMP'S MEDICAL TEAM SAYS HE'S DOING 'VERY WELL'; OFFICIAL WARNS NEXT 48 HOURS ARE 'CRITICAL' Dr. Brian Garibaldi, with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said Trump has completed his second dose of Remdesivir and has exhibited no side effects as far as his team can tell. His team will therefore continue plans to keep him on the medication over a five-day period. In response to transient low oxygen levels, the president also has begun dexamethasone therapy and was given his first dose Saturday. Garibaldi said the president feels well Sunday and the team plans to have him eat and be up and about as much as possible to be mobile, and \"if he continues to look and feel as well as he does today, our hope is that we can plan for a discharge as early as tomorrow to the White House where he can continue his treatment course.\" “As with any illness there are particular ups and downs over the course especially when a patient is being so closely watched 24 hours a day,” Conley said. “The president wanted me to share how proud he is of the group, what an honor it is for him to be receiving his care here at Walter Reed and be surrounded by such incredible talent: academic leaders, department chairs, internationally renowned researchers and clinicians, including the support of Dr. Garibaldi from Johns Hopkins. “I’d like to reiterate how pleased we all are with the president’s recovery,” Conley said. Before the press conference, Trump campaign senior adviser Steve Cortes described the president as \"upbeat and assertive as ever\" as he fights the coronavirus in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” with Chris Wallace. He added: \"This president is going to recover, we are highly confident of that.\" White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said on \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\" Saturday night that the president was experiencing symptoms that had his staff \"real concerned\" on Friday, including fever and low blood oxygen level, but that he has since improved.

President Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden attacked each other in starkly personal terms for more than 90 minutes as moderator Chris Wallace worked to get both candidates, but especially Trump, to follow the debate rules the candidates had agreed to. The conversation ranged from the coronavirus crisis to the Supreme Court vacancy to health care. It's not clear how much substance voters could get out of the debate, however, as it largely consisted of lines aimed to appeal to partisans. Here are the top five moments from the first presidential debate. 1. Biden and Trump clash on who controls the Democratic Party During the initial segment on the Supreme Court vacancy, the discussion turned to health care and Trump began to attack Biden by saying that he would be accountable to the Bernie Sanders-backing segment of his party and its support for \"Medicare-for-all.\" In what was the first of many explosive spats between the pair, Biden shot back that “I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I in fact approved of.\" It was one of the strongest statements from Biden to date distancing himself from the farthest-left wings of the party. Trump would continue to hammer this point throughout the debate. Notably, also on the Supreme Court topic, Wallace asked Biden whether he would be willing to pack the Supreme Court and support the end of the Senate filibuster. Biden flatly refused to take a stance on the issue. 2. Wallace reminds the candidates who the moderator is During the transition between the first segment of the debate and the second segment, Trump talked over Wallace for several seconds as the moderator attempted to get his question in. Wallace eventually raised his voice to say, “I’m the moderator of this debate” before finishing the question. Trump and Biden continually talked with each other throughout much of the debate, leading Wallace at one point to say, “Gentlemen, you realize you’re both speaking at the same time?” Just a couple minutes later while Trump was giving an answer during his two-minute uninterrupted time period, Biden tried to chime in and Wallace responded by reminding Biden the time was Trump’s. Wallace would continue to need to scold both candidates repeatedly. DEBATE GETS PERSONAL AS BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A ‘CLOWN,’ TRUMP TELLS BIDEN HE’S NOT ‘SMART’ 3. \"Just lost the left\" Biden was discussing his health care plan, noting that Democrats in the primary were attacking him over the fact he would not abolish private health insurance, as many of the candidates were proposing. Trump interrupted and accused Biden of having agreed to abolish private health care and institute Medicare-for-all, which Biden has not done. Biden, as Trump was incorrectly accusing him of fibbing about health care and having agreed to a \"manifesto,\" warned Trump he was messing with the “wrong guy, the wrong night at the wrong time.” Trump replied, in regards to Biden openly rejecting Medicare-for-all, “He just lost the left, you just lost the left.” During a discussion about global warming later in the debate, Biden said “the Green New Deal is not my plan” and that he supports “the Biden plan,” which is different than other Green New Deal plans discussed by other Democratic presidential candidates. 4. Biden addresses voters personally on coronavirus One of Biden's most effective moments of the debate came when the topic turned to the coronavirus pandemic and he directly addressed the camera and the voters at home as he made his case for why he is the best person to handle the pandemic. He referenced the recordings from journalist Bob Woodward of Trump saying earlier this year that he downplayed the coronavirus so as not to cause panic, and told Americans, \"You don't panic, he panicked.\" Trump on the topic warned that Biden wants to “shut the country down” and would “destroy the country.” TRUMP TARGETS HUNTER BIDEN'S FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS DURING HEATED DEBATE CLASH 5. Clash over masks and shutdowns As the conversation continued on the topic of coronavirus, Wallace asked Trump why he continues to hold large rallies with no social distancing and sparse mask usage in clear violation of the guidelines from his own administration. Trump defended himself by noting that the rallies happen outside at airports and that \"people want to hear what I have to say.\" Biden responded by telling voters, \"He's not worried about you\" and slammed Trump for the handling of his rallies. \"He's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged him not to,\" Biden said. \"Alright, he's a fool.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump replied by reemphasizing that Biden would close the country and that the shutdowns are \"hurting people\" both financially and in their mental health. Biden in his response said the recovery from the coronavirus crisis may look good in the stock market and for millionaires and billionaires, but that things aren't improving significantly yet for the average person. And Biden said keeping the country shut down would help the economy long term. \"You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis,\" Biden said. \"He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The explosive New York Times report on Donald Trump’s tax returns confirms a great number of things about the president’s finances we’ve only been able to speculate about for years. We now know that Trump really was telling the truth when he claimed, beginning in the 2016 presidential campaign, that he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service (though such an audit would not prevent him from releasing his returns—that part he really did make up). We also now know—though we basically already did—that while Trump made a lot of money from The Apprentice, he really does love debt, and most of the businesses he’s actually run have lost a lot of money. All told, Trump has personally guaranteed about $421 million in debt, most of which will come due within the next four years. The returns that the Times describes, stretching from 2000–17, raise a host of issues you would generally not want a president to have: There are foreign payments to Trump businesses (a possible influence on foreign policy), apparent fibbing about property valuations (Trump allegedly inflated the value of property he owned so that he could overstate the value of an environmental easement he claimed as a charitable deduction), and payments to his daughter as a consultant (even though he also employed her as a senior executive at his real estate company). One of the most stunning revelations—beyond the headline figure that Trump paid only $750 in taxes in 2016 and again in 2017—is of Trump’s attempt to get a refund from the IRS for $72 million in 2010 by claiming $1.4 billion in losses in 2008 and 2009, which would not only justify the refund but also wipe out any income tax he would owe for years to come. This request apparently triggered the audit we’ve heard so much about. This wasn’t the first time Trump pulled such a move. We learned from tax returns leaked in the runup to the 2016 election that Donald Trump claimed a $915.7 million loss in 1995, which he used to avoid paying taxes for about 10 years. Add the $1.4 billion from the Times’ new reporting and you’ve got well over $2 billion in losses, quite impressive for a man who bills himself as a savvy businessman with an almost preternatural ability to spot and make deals. The earlier loss was related to his failed casino business: Trump borrowed about $1 billion and lost it. If Trump had defaulted on the debt and it had been forgiven, he would have had to pay tax on the canceled debt. Otherwise, both Trump and the bank could claim a loss on the loans. However, the banks swapped this debt for equity in the failing business. By all rights, this swap should have resulted in canceled debt income to Trump—and a tax bill—because the equity was worth significantly less than the debt owed. Somehow that got lost in the shuffle. The result was that Trump got to earn about $1 billion of income going forward and pay no tax on it until 2005. Back to the new documents: About $700 million of the most recent loss also appears to be casino-related (the rest appear to be from operating losses suffered by Trump’s businesses). According to the Times, Trump claimed to have abandoned a partnership interest in that same floundering casino business, generating the loss. However, he may have received an equity interest in the reorganized casino entity, which undermines his claim of “abandonment” and should have prevented him from taking the loss. We have no way of knowing whether the IRS audited Trump back in the 1990s, when he claimed the first loss. Given the IRS’s limited resources, things do slip by. This time, however, he couldn’t escape IRS scrutiny. It’s one thing to avoid taxes you should pay by understating your income or claiming a loss that can be carried forward. It is quite another to ask the government to send you a check for $72 million. Given the possibility of fraud (indeed, there is a cottage industry among some inmates of filing false refund claims so they can bilk the government), Congress wisely requires that all large tax refund requests be reviewed and approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a technocratic, nonpartisan organization that supports both the House and Senate when it comes to tax matters. And that is where this story gets interesting. Trump’s refund claim well exceeded the $2 million threshold for JCT review, and the fact that we’re talking about it now suggests officials had some questions. The New York Times reports that there was a possible settlement in 2014 but that it never happened, and that the committee’s review expanded to include subsequent years, where any unused losses would apply to reduce future income taxes. There’s a lot we don’t know, including what caused the JCT to reject the refund claim, the amount of any proposed settlement in 2014, why the settlement faltered, and why the dispute has not yet been resolved. We also don’t know whether the more recent loss was a real loss of Trump’s money or again reflected money he had borrowed and lost. The one thing we do know is that, while Trump may have made a lot of money selling his name and as a reality television star, he has lost money in just about every business venture he has been actively involved with. The national average for tax refunds is about $3,000, typically due because employers overwithhold federal income taxes. Trump’s request for $72 million is a few standard deviations above the mean. Contrary to some speculation, Trump’s returns and the refund request makes clear that he has actually made a significant amount of money over the years and he has actually paid some tax on that income (though not a lot relative to the income he’s earned). If he prevails in claiming this second massive loss, he will have succeeded in paying almost nothing in income taxes on more than $2 billion of income. No one is obligated to pay more in taxes than is actually owed. However, there is a difference between good tax planning and tax evasion. It looks like we will need to wait for the resolution of Trump’s refund request and accompanying audit to see what the government ultimately concludes about the merits. Either way, Trump reportedly paid $750 in income taxes over the past two years for which we have data—and tried to pay nothing for many years before that. I wonder how that will play with his base voters, many of whom earn far less yet pay so much more. With an election he’s losing entering its final stretch, the audit still outstanding, and more than $400 million in personally guaranteed debt coming due, it may finally be time for Trump to pay up.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The New York Times really needs to get its complaint straight. Apparently, President Trump is a no-good businessman who never makes any money, and so he aggressively avoids tax payments, paying just $750 in income taxes in 2016 and 2017 (if the report is true, which Trump has unsurprisingly called “fake news“). No doubt, he has to be aggressive to ensure he doesn’t pay taxes on money he hasn’t made. Or maybe it’s all just another reason to stand in Midtown Manhattan shrieking about Trump. Because there’s nothing in Trump’s tax information that would frighten a tax accountant — just take a quick look at the New York Times’s own accounts. They save up losses ($500 million in 2006! $70 million in 2008!) which they then put against future profits — as every company and business has the right to do, and every reasonable, sensible, tax system allows. They take depreciation on buildings, $8 million a quarter on their new one apparently. They pay consultants, as consultants tend not to do the work if they think they won’t be paid. There’s simply nothing at all in Trump’s taxes that is even odd or out of line. There are two logical problems to what is being said against Trump, though. Trump can’t be both making no money and also illegally dodging taxes. That just can’t happen — if you’re not making money, then you don’t owe taxes, that should be simple enough to understand. Or, the other way around: You cannot be illegally dodging taxes that aren’t owed. So, people complaining need to make a decision about what it is they’re going to complain about. The second is this very idea of tax avoidance. It’s not a thing. It doesn’t actually exist. Avoidance is the Schrodinger’s Cat of taxes. The original thought experiment was meant, when concocted, to show how silly quantum was. Stick a cat in a box with some poison and a radioactive atom. When the atom decays, it releases the poison and kills the cat. We cannot know when or if the atom decays from outside the box. Therefore we don’t know whether that cat is dead or not. Until we open the box, that is. The cat, being quantum now, exists in some indeterminate state of being both dead and alive until we do. It is possible to make an attempt to avoid taxes, sure. We all do that every time we claim a deduction. The thing is, once the IRS has signed off on that declaration, then the attempt collapses out of that quantum state into being allowed (in which case it is simply obeying the law as it is written) or not allowed, in which case it is illegal tax evasion. Tax avoidance isn’t a thing at all. It’s an indeterminate state until decided. And these returns being examined, except for the one we’ll come to, have been signed off on from the IRS. It’s all, therefore, obeying the law. As to whether Trump is actually rich or not, tax returns won’t tell anyone that. While loans against assets are discussed, by the very nature of the documents, the value of the assets won’t be. Wealth is assets minus debts, something that just cannot be calculated with what’s in tax returns. There is something truly interesting in here, though: the long-running claim that Trump can’t release his tax returns because there’s an audit going on. Which there is, about a refund he received in 2010. This has been sitting at the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation since 2011. Thus, as always, wherever there’s a screwup or inefficiency in the system, Congress is at the bottom of it. After all, they’re also responsible for all the other parts of the tax system.

In January, as the virus began to spread outside of the country's borders, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global health emergency, but it wasn’t officially deemed a global pandemic until March. Since then, the world has been watching as companies race to develop a vaccine, and numerous countries issued lockdowns in hopes of containing the virus’ spread and cutting down on the number of fatalities, but outbreaks at nursing homes and other care facilities added thousands to the death toll. Advancements in testing capabilities and contact tracing allowed for some return to normalcy, but not without officials warning of risk and governors issuing a series of mandates for face coverings and social distancing. Still, as countries reopened borders and loosened the coronavirus-related restrictions on travel, dining and other social events, health officials sounded the alarm over possible spikes in cases and the danger of a second wave. \"As we get into the fall and the winter, you really want the level of community spread to be as low as you possibility get it,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert and face of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, told ABC News recently. \"There's certainly parts of the country that are doing well, but there are states that are starting to show an uptick in cases and even some increases in hospitalizations in some states. And, I hope not, but, we very well might start seeing increases in deaths.\" CORONAVIRUS INFECTED YOUNG ADULTS MORE THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS OVER SUMMER, CDC REPORT SAYS Fauci said now is the time to \"double down\" on enforcing public health measures in an effort to avoid having another shutdown in the U.S. In the U.K., a number of regions have been forced to re-enter a lockdown period following a spike in positive COVID-19 test results, and WHO’s regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said it should serve as a “wake-up call” to others who may be experiencing “quarantine fatigue.” “Weekly cases have now exceeded those reported when the pandemic first peaked in Europe in March,” Kluge said, according to the New York Post. “Although these numbers reflect more comprehensive testing, it also shows alarming rates of transmission across the region.” MOST AMERICANS LIKELY VULNERABLE TO CORONAVIRUS INFECTION, CDC DIRECTOR SAYS Health officials had also hoped that antibody testing would provide guidance on how to safely reopen, but a study based on data made available in 46 states in the U.S. found that less than 10 percent of Americans have COVID-19 antibodies. Last week, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told a Senate committee that preliminary results from large-scale serology testing across the U.S. suggested that most Americans likely remain vulnerable to infection. The health agency also released data that shows the mortality rate from COVID-19 remains extremely low for young people, but there’s a recent rise in cases among this population, and those individuals pose a risk for the more vulnerable age groups who are more susceptible to the virus. Americans aged 20-29 now account for more than 20% of all cases, with officials noting that the shift in age, particularly in the southern regions hit by outbreaks in June, suggests that the \"younger adults likely contributed to community transmission of COVID-19.\" CRUISE LINES AWAIT CDC DECISION ON POSSIBLE EXTENSION OF 'NO SAIL' ORDER The U.S., which has had over 7.1 million cases of COVID-19 and has made massive strides in testing capabilities since the outbreak first began, currently leads the world in coronavirus-related deaths with nearly 205,000 fatalities, while Brazil follows with almost 142,000 coronavirus-associated deaths.

Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential election. Video footage captured by Project Veritas shows an operative, Liban Mohamed, bragging about collecting hundreds of ballots. “Numbers do not lie. Numbers do not lie. … You can see my car is full. All these here are absentee ballots. Can’t you see? Look at all these; my car is full,” Mohamed can be heard saying in the video. The video also includes testimony from a whistleblower, Omar Jamal, who called Rep. Omar’s alleged ballot harvesting an “open secret” and also discussed an alleged cash-for-votes scheme organized by staffers of Rep. Omar. “She [Ilhan Omar] will do anything that she can do to get elected and she [Ilhan Omar] has hundreds of people on the streets doing that,” said Jamal. James O’Keefe, the founder and CEO of Project Veritas, said, “Ballot harvesting is real, and it has become a big business. Our investigation into this ballot harvesting ring demonstrates clearly how these unscrupulous operators exploit the elderly and immigrant communities — and have turned the sacred ballot box into a commodities trading desk.” O’Keefe said, “We are showing Americans what is really going on in one of our great cities — but, it is not me saying — we have the operatives on tape saying it all themselves.” Project Veritas said its investigation found three locations inside Ward 6, a ballot harvesting triangle, where the scheme operates: The Riverside Plaza apartments, the senior citizen community at Horn Towers, and the Minneapolis Elections and Voter Services office at 980 E. Hennepin Ave., which also functions as a voting location and ballot drop-off site. Jared Edge, the chief legal officer for Project Veritas, said that Mohamed and other ballot harvesters could face heavy penalties for their alleged violations of the law. “The federal laws, 18 USC §597 and 52 USC §10307(c), are quite clear,” he said. “In the case of 18 USC §597, it is punishable by up to two years in prison and in the case of 52 USC §10307 it’s punishable by up to $10,000 in fines and up to five years in prison.” The Minnesota statute 211B.13(1) prohibits paying a person or receiving money to register to vote or to vote, he said. “This is a state felony punishable by more than one-year imprisonment.” Beyond paying voters, there are also state and federal laws regarding intimidation of voters, he said. “The federal laws 52 USC §20511, 18 USC §594, and 52 USC §10307(b) and the Minnesota statue 211B.07 prohibit anyone from using undue influence, threats, intimidation, or fraud to influence a person’s vote or to influence them to vote at all,” he said. “It is also a violation of federal law for anyone who votes for others illegally,” he said. “The punishment under 52 USC §10307(e) also goes up to five years’ incarceration and a $10,000 fine,” he said. “In addition to those statutes, Minnesota has another statute, 211B.11(3), which makes it a misdemeanor to induce or persuade a voter to vote for or against a candidate while transporting the voter to the polls,” he said.

In a statement, former Vice President Joe Biden focused on Coney Barrett’s “written track record of disagreeing with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision upholding the Affordable Care Act.” Her criticism of the decision is particularly important because the court is scheduled to hear a major challenge to the healthcare law the week after the November election. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) put the stakes in stark terms. “If this nominee is confirmed,” Pelosi said in a statement, “millions of families’ health care will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that has infected seven million Americans and killed over 200,000 people in our country.” Beyond healthcare, Sen.

Video posted to social media shows a blue truck striking a protester who was holding a sign, knocking the person to the ground. The incident happened after the driver became involved in an altercation while maneuvering through the crowd of more than 300 protesters, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. \"As the driver attempted to get away from the situation, he struck a protester standing in the street,\" the LAPD said in a statement shared on Twitter. CBS Los Angeles reports the driver drove off and was initially detained by law enforcement a few blocks away from the scene before being allowed to leave. The protester was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, police said. After that incident, the driver of a white Prius tried to drive past the same demonstration and \"also became involved in an altercation with individuals in the crowd,\" said the LAPD. That driver then drove through an intersection, striking a number of protesters before being boxed in by two other vehicles while protesters hit the windows. The Prius sped off and was later stopped by police. No one was injured in the second incident, according to police. \"All of the drivers and victims involved in both altercations have been identified by Hollywood Officers and the investigation is continuing,\" the LAPD said. The largely peaceful demonstration began at about 7 p.m. Hundreds gathered to protest the grand jury decision in the March shooting death of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville, Kentucky. Thursday marked the second night of demonstrations in Los Angeles following the decision to not charge any of the officers directly for Taylor's death. One former officer, Brett Hankison, was charged with wanton endangerment for firing shots into Taylor's neighbor's apartment. The other two officers who opened fire in Taylor's home, Detective Myles Cosgrove and Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly, were not charged. Protests continue nationwide Protests have since taken place across the country, continuing a movement against police brutality and racial injustice that gained momentum following the police killing of George Floyd earlier this year in Minneapolis. In Louisville, police in riot gear barricaded roads and cars honked as the crowd marched past a nighttime curfew. Officers blocked the exits of a church where protesters gathered to avoid arrest for violating the curfew. Several people were detained, including state Rep. Attica Scott, a Louisville Democrat who unveiled legislation called \"Breonna's Law\" that would ban the use of no-knock search warrants in Kentucky. In New York City, protesters marched again Thursday following Wednesday's grand jury decision. One of them, Sami Disu, brought his 2-year-old daughter. \"It makes sense for me to involve her early on in a fight that she is going to grow up to inherit,\" he told CBS New York.

New York City, Portland and Seattle are on the list of \"anarchist cities\" that Trump officials say have failed to stem crime linked to a summer of protests. It follows a memo from Mr Trump earlier this month, threatening the move. The mayors of the cities have promised to sue, calling Mr Trump's move a political stunt. A statement from the justice department on Monday laid out recent crime rates in the cities and how their police responded. \"We cannot allow federal tax dollars to be wasted when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance,\" Attorney General William Barr said in the statement. He also called on Portland, Seattle and New York City to \"reverse course and become serious about performing the basic function of government and start protecting their own citizens\". The department statement noted that these cities were highlighted as they meet key criteria, such as forbidding \"the police force from intervening to restore order amid widespread or sustained violence or destruction\", as well as seeking to disempower or defund police. Refusing to accept federal law enforcement assistance is also a factor. All three cities have seen major protests since the death of unarmed black man George Floyd in May. It remains unclear what federal funding may be cut from the cities. CNBC reports that some of the funds targeted by Mr Trump's memo comprise a large portion of New York City's annual budget, which has already been stretched thin by the pandemic. In a joint statement, the mayors of Portland, Seattle, New York and Washington DC - which was on a shortlist of \"anarchist cities\" but was not included in Monday's decision - accused Mr Trump of \"playing cheap political games with congressionally directed funds\". The mayors called the decision \"thoroughly political and unconstitutional\" and accused the Trump White House of \"shirking responsibility and placing blame elsewhere to cover its failure\". Violent crimes have generally declined in US cities since the 1990s, but have risen steeply in the past year in several cities including Philadelphia, Chicago and New York. What is happening in those cities? The move comes amid a summer of unrest sparked by protests against the police killing of black Americans. Some of the protests have led to major police reforms around the country. In New York City, the rate of shootings and murders has skyrocketed as youth programmes and other social organisations have been placed on hold due to the pandemic. Cases of looting and vandalism have also made national news as protests for racial justice have sometimes turned violent. Reacting to the justice department announcement on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the decision \"another one of President Trump's games\", adding: \"It's insulting to the people of New York City and his [Mr Trump's] effort to withhold our funding is unconstitutional.\" Seattle permitted the establishment of a so-called \"autonomous zone\" where protesters forbade police from entering an area near the city centre for nearly a month. The zone was dismantled in early July after several shootings. Nightly protests have continued since. Portland, Oregon, has often been invoked by Mr Trump as a \"Democrat-run\" city that has supposedly allowed violence. Protests have continued nightly there for over 100 consecutive days, sometimes devolving to violence and vandalism as protesters fight with police.", "output": "center"}

The president’s statement comes after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., just hours after Ginsburg’s passing, vowed that a Trump nominee to the Supreme Court “will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” “The Senate and the nation mourn the sudden passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the conclusion of her extraordinary American life,” McConnell said in a statement. “In the last midterm election before Justice Scalia’s death in 2016, Americans elected a Republican Senate majority because we pledged to check and balance the last days of a lame-duck president’s second term. We kept our promise,” McConnell continued. “Since the 1880s, no Senate has confirmed an opposite-party president’s Supreme Court nominee in a presidential election year.” McConnell added that, “by contrast, Americans reelected our majority in 2016 and expanded it in 2018 because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary.” “Once again, we will keep our promise,” he said. “President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.” But the nomination and confirmation process for the latest addition to the Supreme Court, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, took 89 days total for confirmation. It took 57 days from Kavanaugh's nomination to his confirmation hearing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP There are 44 days until Election Day.

Uncertainty remains high regarding vaccine efficacy, while Department of Defense officials tried to assure reporters briefed Wednesday morning that logistics will be in place for the manufacturing and distribution of hundreds of millions of doses. “We’re dealing in a world of great uncertainty,” said Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. “We don’t know the timing of when we’ll have a vaccine.” Mango avoided the exuberant language of recent present briefings where he underscored that efforts were on schedule or ahead of schedule. One vaccine effort, AstraZeneca, was forced to suspend trials after a volunteer illness. He did, however, highlight that all six of the vaccine efforts would be in the final stage of trials by the end of the year, and once approved, they will be shipped within 24 hours. “Our goal at Operation Warp Speed is that 24 hours after [FDA emergency use authorization] issued that we have vaccine moving to administration sites,” he said. HHS has been working on a joint vaccine and therapeutics effort with the Department of Defense since May 15 with a stated goal of delivering a safe and efficient vaccine by Jan. 1, 2021. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield said the goal of 300 million vaccines is still central to the effort. “The CDC’s goal, and that of the U.S. government, is to have enough COVID-19 vaccine for all people in the United States who wish to be vaccinated,” he said.", "output": "right"}

The Problem Solvers Caucus released its $1.5 trillion coronavirus plan as proof bipartisanship is still afoot and to deliver a pre-packaged solution to Republican and Democratic leadership that would meet the nation's most pressing needs for the next six to 12 months. There's been no progress on a new coronavirus package in the last four months, although schools, families and businesses continue to suffer and the coronavirus continues its deadly spread, having killed more than 193,000 Americans. SENATE FAILS TO ADVANCE 'TARGETED' $300B CORONAVIRUS BILL; RELIEF IN LIMBO So the 50-member caucus -- equally divided between Democrats and Republicans -- spent six weeks trying to find a solution they believe can pass the House, Senate and be signed into law by President Trump. Four of the caucus lawmakers spoke to Fox News to preview the plan before its public release and they lamented that talks between the White House and Democrats are \"stuck.\" They viewed their newly minted proposal as a \"framework\" to break the logjam. \"Our goal is to get people back to the table,\" one lawmaker told Fox News. Among the highlights of the $1.5 trillion plan: -- $120 billion for enhanced unemployment aid through January 2021 at a rate of $450 weekly for an eight-week transition period until states can reconfigure to the new system that would provide up to $600 weekly, but not to exceed 100% of the previous wage. -- $500.3 billion in state and local aid, which includes $130 billion for documented coronavirus state and local expenses through 2021, $120.3 billion for documented local budget shortfalls and $250 billion for proven state government shortfalls. -- $280 billion for another round of direct stimulus checks worth $1,200 for adults and $500 for children. Dependent adults would also qualify for money until this plan. -- $290 billion for small business and nonprofit assistance, including $240 billion for another round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds and $50 billion for a targeted employee retention tax credit. -- New automatic triggers in the legislation that would provide an additional $400 billion boost through another round of stimulus checks in March 2021 and extended unemployment insurance through February if the virus still isn't under control based on hospitalization rates and vaccine progress. And if the virus is under control, then there's an automatic $200 billion reduction in spending taken from the PPP program, state and local aid and rental assistance. Unlike the recent partisan efforts, the Problems Solvers' caucus worked together in a bipartisan way to find common ground. The $3 trillion HEROES Act that passed the House in May was authored by Democrats. And both the $1 trillion July plan and the $300 billion September plan put forth in the Senate were devised just with GOP input. PENNSYLVANIA CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS DEEMED UNCONSTITUTIONAL, FEDERAL JUDGE RULES \"We wanted to demonstrate that there is common ground here,\" another lawmaker told Fox News. \"And when you put the people's needs first, and you take politics and you set it aside you can actually have a good conversation.\" One way they were able to address GOP concerns about unfettered funding for state and local governments was to fashion the relief for coronavirus expenses and provable lost revenue due to the economic fallout, rather than just providing the nearly $1 trillion Democrats wanted. And they took both GOP and Democratic plans into account on the federal unemployment boost. It's the $600 weekly Democrats wanted but with the caveat that the benefits can't exceed current wages, a nod to Republicans' concerns that people wouldn't go back to work if they were making more money to stay home. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Other provisions in the proposal include $100 billion for coronavirus testing and health care; $145 billion for schools and child care centers; $15 billion for the United States Postal Service and the elimination of the USPS full pre-funding requirement for retiree health benefits; $11 billion for food assistance, $25 billion for rental assistance; $400 million for states for election costs and certain protections from coronavirus lawsuits if business and schools follow enhanced worker safety protocols. The caucus is led by Reps. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J. A formal news conference on the plan is slated for later Tuesday.", "output": "right"}

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department announced the six-figure reward late Sunday for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of a person seen on dramatic video walking up to a stopped police car, opening fire and running away, critically injuring the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies inside. Authorities said the two officers were sitting in their patrol car at the MLK Transit Center in Compton shortly before 7 p.m. Saturday when the shooter ambushed them – approaching the LASD vehicle from behind and firing several bullets inside. Investigators are still looking for the attacker, whom they described as a Black man who appears to be between 28 to 30 years old and who was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting. TRUMP CALLS FOR SWIFT JUSTICE IN SHOOTING OF AMBUSHED DEPUTIES AS MANHUNT INTENSIFIES IN LA The sheriff’s deputies’ injuries were listed as critical immediately after the shooting, and both underwent surgery, police said. Their conditions have since been updated to stable, according to multiple reports. Sheriff Alex Villanueva said during a subsequent press conference that the victims “survived the shooting and [are] recovering, a double miracle,” the Los Angeles Times reported, noting that both deputies were shot in the head. Both victims -- a 24-year-old man and a 31-year-old mother of a 6-year-old -- were sworn in just over a year ago, according to the L.A. Times report. “There is no rhyme or reason to it; it is an act of a coward,” Villanueva reportedly said. “Obviously tensions were running high in the neighborhood with the deputy-involved shooting. But there is no nexus to it at this time. We are chasing all leads.” Shortly after the shooting, police were faced with protests at the entrance to the hospital where the injured deputies were being treated. A series of tweets from the LA County Sheriffs describes how demonstrators were “blocking the entrance & exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM” and yelling, \"We hope they die.\" BIDEN PUSHES GUN CONTROL LESS THAN 24 HOURS AFTER ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION ON DEPUTIES “Do not block emergency entries and exits to the hospital,” the tweet further states. “People’s lives are at stake when ambulances can’t get through.” Police later announced the arrests of two individuals at the hospital, including a woman who was later identified as a member of the press, after she allegedly “ignored repeated commands to stay back as they struggled” with arresting the other person,” police said. LOS ANGELES MAYOR CALLS PROTESTS OUTSIDE HOSPITAL TREATING WOUNDED SHERIFFS 'ABHORRENT' “The female adult, who was later identified as a member of the press, did not identify herself as press and later admitted she did not have proper press credentials on her person,” police said. “Both individuals have been arrested.\" Any person with information in connection with the attack can leave an anonymous tip by calling Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (8477).", "output": "right"}

NEW FOX NEWS POLL: BIDEN TOPPING TRUMP IN WISCONSIN Biden said he is seeking common ground that Trump is incapable of reaching with “law and order” rhetoric and repeated refusals to acknowledge racism confronting Americans with black and brown skin. Biden’s emphasis on unity is a staple of his campaign, during a summer of nationwide protests. Most have been peaceful, but some of them, as in Kenosha, turned violent and destructive. Kenosha was calm ahead of Biden’s visit. By midday, a small group of Biden supporters, some Black Lives Matter activists and a Trump supporter had gathered at a city center park that was a focal point of demonstrations for days.

Forecasters had projected 950,000 new jobless claims. Instead, claims fell to the lowest level since mid-March, before the pandemic induced mass layoffs. The drop hints at a slowdown in layoffs, which would be good news for the reeling labor market. But it also could be an artifact of changes the Labor Department made to its calculation of jobless claims. The agency employed a new methodology for adjusting for seasonal changes in employment, such as teachers returning to work or students quitting their jobs to return to school. The extreme rise in jobless claims caused by the pandemic made such adjustments difficult. An additional 760,000 workers applied for benefits through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which provides for unemployment insurance for people sidelined by the epidemic who normally wouldn’t be eligible for benefits, such as gig workers whose business dried up. Seasonally unadjusted claims for regular benefits were just over 833,000 last week and have been trending lower, suggesting that there has been real underlying improvement in the labor market. Weekly seasonally adjusted claims had generally been running above 1 million since March. Before, such a high number would have been almost unthinkable. The highest number registered during the Great Recession, in 2009, was 665,000. As the coronavirus hit the United States and the economy locked down to slow its spread, jobless claims skyrocketed in March, with 6.9 million filing for benefits for the week ending March 28. The number of workers claiming unemployment benefits dropped precipitously through the end of May but remained above a million until the week ending Aug. 8 before reversing course and rising above a million again for the prior two weeks. The overall jobs situation is dire. There were nearly 30 million people claiming benefits in all jobless programs for the week ending Aug.15. There was roughly 1.6 million people claiming those benefits in the comparable week in 2019.", "output": "right"}

Some estimates put the death toll even higher. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump shared two posts that falsely claimed COVID-19 deaths are not as high as previously thought. The posts claimed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its COVID-19 death numbers to show that only 9,210 Americans have died from the virus. Twitter removed the first tweet for violating its rules. Another post from Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser for the Trump campaign, linked to a story from the Gateway Pundit, a conservative news site. That tweet was still up as of publication. The tweets misconstrue federal data on COVID-19 victims. As of Aug. 31, the CDC reported that 182,622 Americans have died since the start of the pandemic — and some estimates put the death toll even higher. The agency told us that the vast majority of deaths involving COVID-19 can be attributed to the virus. Claims that the CDC adjusted its COVID-19 death numbers appear to have originated on Facebook before making their way to Trump’s Twitter feed, according to VineSight, an organization that uses artificial intelligence to surface potential misinformation. Several posts have been shared thousands of times.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Posts misconstrue CDC data The social media posts trace back to an Aug. 26 update from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which is part of the CDC. The report is updated every Wednesday and outlines provisional death counts for COVID-19. In his post, King cited an older version of a data table about deaths from COVID-19 in combination with other conditions, such as pneumonia and influenza. In a section titled \"Comorbidities,\" the NCHS wrote: \"For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\" That data comes from death certificates. King cited an older version of the NCHS report that analyzed 153,504 deaths involving COVID-19. Six percent of that figure is 9,210. To some readers, the report may appear to confirm his math. But it doesn’t. In medicine, comorbidities are conditions that patients experience in tandem with a primary condition. According to the CDC, people with preexisting conditions like cancer and diabetes are more at risk of death if they contract the coronavirus. The NCHS report shows that the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths occur in patients with comorbidities. But that doesn’t mean COVID-19 wasn’t a factor. \"A small number of people have COVID ascribed as the sole cause of death. It may be they had no comorbidities or they were just not noted,\" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"However, it is also clear that advanced age and several other underlying diseases lead to bad outcomes with COVID infections. The people dying were not going to die but for the acquisition of COVID.\" In a Facebook post addressing claims about the NCHS report, Dr. Mark Halstead, an associate professor of orthopedic surgery and pediatrics at Washington University, broke down how conditions are listed on a patient’s death certificate. RELATED: Don’t trust this comparison of daily coronavirus deaths with other diseases Featured Fact-check \"So, let's say someone was admitted to the hospital because of symptoms of COVID. They test positive, so COVID would be listed,\" Halstead said in the post. \"Their case progressed where they developed respiratory failure and now are on a ventilator. Respiratory failure can be listed.\" Additional conditions may be listed on a patient’s death certificate during the course of their stay in the hospital. For example, if a COVID-19 patient ended up dying from cardiac arrest, that could also be included. \"So now three things are listed on their death certificate,\" Halstead wrote. \"The COVID infection started the process but that led to the heart and lungs failing, which killed that person.\" Jeff Lancashire, acting associate director for communications at the NCHS, told us in an email that while 94% of death certificates that mention COVID-19 also listed other conditions, the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 in almost all of them. \"The underlying cause of death is the condition that began the chain of events that ultimately led to the person’s death,\" he said. \"In 92% of all deaths that mention COVID-19, COVID-19 is listed as the underlying cause of death.\" We reached out to King for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. Our ruling A Facebook post claimed that the CDC decreased the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. from 153,504 to 9,210. That’s wrong. As of Aug. 31, the CDC counted 182,622 Americans who had died because of the coronavirus. A NCHS report found that, for about 6% of Americans who die from the virus, COVID-19 is the only condition listed on their death certificates. But that doesn’t mean the remaining 94% didn’t die due to the coronavirus. People with preexisting conditions, such as cancer or diabetes, have a higher risk of dying if they contract COVID-19. Complications from those conditions, as well as comorbidities like influenza and pneumonia, can be listed in addition to the coronavirus on death certificates. In 92% of death certificates that mention the virus, COVID-19 was the underlying cause of death, according to the NCHS. The Facebook post is inaccurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Tuesday night's shooting took place near a gas station following a confrontation between protesters and men armed with guns who claimed to be guarding the gas station, the New York Times reported. Kenosha police said officers responded to shots fired at around 11:45 p.m. Police did not release the names of the victims, but said a 26-year-old man from Silver Lake and a 36-year-old man from Kenosha had been killed. Another 26-year-old man who was shot was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries. Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old white man, was arrested in connection with the shootings on Wednesday morning in Antioch, Illinois, which is about 20 miles from Kenosha. He was charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Kenosha and was separately charged as a fugitive from justice in Antioch, according to police records obtained by BuzzFeed News. Rittenhouse allegedly fled Wisconsin after the shooting \"with the intent to avoid prosecution,\" the police complaint said. Lake County Circuit Court records show that he will appear in court again on Friday for an extradition hearing. In a live video on Facebook, Dylan Schultz, a 28-year-old protester, recorded the armed suspect running away from a crowd after multiple gunshots were heard and a person fell to the ground after being shot in the head. Schultz told BuzzFeed News that he walking by the gas station and tire shop where armed militia were \"menacing\" to the crowd of protesters and \"pointing weapons in their faces.\" He said some people in the crowd walked further down to a car shop where they began smashing in windows with pipes and skateboards and slashing tires. Schultz said he was across the street when he saw that \"the kid in the green shirt ran up with his long gun, puffed out his chest, and thought that he needed to step up and do something.\" The armed suspect then opened fire at a person who appeared to be unarmed, Schultz said. A graphic video shows people trying to help the man who was reported to have been shot in the head. In Schultz's video, the armed man is then seen running away with his gun. Within minutes, the same armed man was caught on another video running down a street as protesters chase him. As the man falls to the ground, he fires multiple shots into the crowd, striking one man in the chest and another in the arm. The armed man is then seen walking down the street toward a police car with his hands in the air as armored trucks pass by him. He was not apprehended. When asked about this later in the day, Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth essentially said it was loud and sometimes officers have \"tunnel vision.\" In another video clip, a law enforcement official in an armored truck is seen handing over a bottle of water to the same armed man. It is unclear when the video was taken. In a separate video, the armed man says he was \"pepper-sprayed by a person in the crowd\" and that he was ready to defend property. A militia group calling itself Kenosha Guard on Facebook said they had mobilized their members during Tuesday night's protests. Their page says they are \"a group of citizen volunteers that are ready to protect our great City.\" In a Facebook post before Tuesday's protests, the group called for \"patriots willing to take up arms and defend our City tonight from the evil thugs.\" In a statement on Wednesday, the group said it was unaware if the armed suspect involved in the shooting \"was answering the Kenosha Guard Militia's call to arms.\" Sheriff Beth told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he was aware of the \"vigilante group,\" but said that he did not know if the suspect was involved with that group. A live video on Facebook captured the confrontation between a group of armed civilians and Black Lives Matter protesters at the gas station before the shooting on Tuesday night. The video shows them verbally sparring as well as objects being thrown. An unidentified armed civilian present during Tuesday night's protests told the Washington Post that he was there to stop people from breaking into local businesses and that he had heard rumors of people throwing pipe bombs. It is unclear if pipe bombs were used during Tuesday night's demonstrations. \"If the cops aren’t going to stop them from throwing pipe bombs on innocent civilians, somebody has to,” the man said. \"Ain’t nothing being done. We're the only ones,\" Joe, a 29-year-old man who identified himself as a US Marine veteran, told the Post. \"Three thousand of us are armed and ready. Sheriff Beth on Wednesday addressed the issue of armed militia patrolling the city, calling them a \"liability.\" Beth said that when someone asked him why he doesn't deputize citizens with guns to patrol the city, he responded, \"Oh, hell no. What happened last night...is the perfect reason why I wouldn't... They are a liability to me, the county, and the state,\" Beth said. Kenosha has been plunged into three days of civil unrest after a police officer shot Blake seven times as he got into his car with three of his children nearby on Sunday. Blake's family and attorney said he has been paralyzed by a bullet. The shooting, captured on viral video, has sparked demonstrations during which police teargassed protesters and businesses were broken into and burned, prompting Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers to deploy the National Guard to Kenosha. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced he was sending federal law enforcement officers to Kenosha. Evers authorized 500 members of the Wisconsin National Guard on Wednesday to support local law enforcement in Kenosha County, a spokesperson for the governor's office told BuzzFeed News.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "In his third run for president, Joe Biden finally secured the Democratic presidential nomination and opened his Thursday night acceptance speech on a unifying note. “I’m a proud Democrat,” Biden said. “And I’ll be proud to carry the banner of our party into the general election. … But while I’ll be a Democratic candidate, I will be an American president. I’ll work hard for those who didn’t support me — as hard for them as I did for those who did vote for me.” He continued, “That’s the job of a president — to represent all of us, not just our base or our party. This is not a partisan moment. This must be an American moment.” This was an effective pitch to voters. One of the criticisms of President Trump that will likely resonate beyond the core Democratic electorate is that Trump is petty and thin-skinned. He often comes across as if he’s only interested in taking care of his “people,” without appreciating the weight of the office, or understanding his responsibility to serve all people. After years of pitched partisan battles, persuadable voters are no doubt ready to move toward a more civil form of politics, even if it only exists in romanticized notions of the past. While Biden’s pitch may be politically effective, however, the nonpartisan message is incongruous with the actual agenda that Biden has outlined in the campaign, which, if enacted, would represent the most sweeping liberal changes in American history. On the very day that Biden was accepting his nomination with a message of unity, Sen. Chuck Schumer, who hopes to be Senate majority leader come January, reaffirmed that he was prepared to kill the filibuster using the so-called nuclear option if it were necessary to advance liberal policy goals. Biden himself has also signaled openness to the idea. The four nights of the just-concluded Democratic National Convention were reminders of this central tension. Viewers heard a pitch from former Republican Gov. John Kasich and saw a video of Biden’s close friendship with the late Sen. John McCain. Throughout the programming, there were constant references to Biden’s ability to work with Republicans and bring people together. But at the same time, there were the constant reminders of the coalition Biden would be working with — socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and radical lawmakers Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Biden’s pick for vice president, Sen. Kamala Harris, has one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate and called for the elimination of private health insurance and confiscation of guns. Biden himself has proposed trillions of dollars in new taxes and spending as well as the creation of a new government-run healthcare plan that was too extreme of an idea to be included in the healthcare law President Barack Obama signed. And he has backed taxpayer funding of abortions, forced by the Left to abandon his previous ground on the issue. As a candidate, especially running a low-key campaign in the time of a pandemic, Biden may be able to paper over this tension. But it is not something that he will be able to ignore as president. That is, either Biden follows through on his promises to be a nonpartisan leader who works with and represents Republicans as well as Democrats, in which case, he will have to scale back his ideological agenda. Or, he will try to follow through on his promises to the left wing of his party, in which case, he’s going to have to push Schumer to kill the filibuster and ram through his agenda on a purely partisan basis. In this sense, there is a lesson from the presidency of his old boss, Obama. Obama ran in 2008 as a post-partisan figure while also proposing a transformational agenda. By the end of his presidency, he was boasting that he had a “pen and phone” and was governing by executive order.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The Senate Intelligence Committee said in a long-awaited report released Tuesday that there is no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence the 2016 election, affirming the findings of other investigations into an alleged Trump-Kremlin conspiracy. The Intelligence Committee’s report, which clocks in at 966 pages, also offers a scathing assessment of the FBI’s handling of the so-called Steele dossier, a key document in the Trump-Russia collusion conspiracy theory. The report says: The FBI gave the Steele Dossier unjustified credence, based on an incomplete understanding of [Christopher] Steele’s past reporting record. The Committee found that, within the FBI, the dossier was given a veneer of credibility by lax procedures and layered misunderstandings. The report, crafted by both Republicans and Democrats, describes a series of roadblocks and hurdles that the Senate committee faced in investigating information from Steele, a former MI6 officer for the British government hired to investigate Donald Trump on behalf of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign. The report says that Steele “repeatedly refused” to meet with the panel, though he ultimately submitted written responses on Aug. 16, 2018. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s office also refused to provide information about its investigation into the dossier, the report says. The report says the Senate committee was limited in its investigation because of “the centralization of information regarding the dossier” at the special counsel’s office, and prosecutors’ “decision not to share that information” with the committee. The committee interviewed several Steele associates who helped disseminate the dossier, including Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, former State Department official Jonathan Winer, and David Kramer, a former associate of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The FBI relied heavily on information from Steele to obtain warrants to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a Trump campaign aide in 2016 who is accused in the dossier of masterminding a conspiracy between Trump associates and the Kremlin. “We can say, without any hesitation, that the Committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election,” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the acting chairman of the Senate panel, said in a statement. The panel raised concerns over Steele’s links to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Steele had “multiple” links to Deripaska, having worked for the Russian’s attorneys from 2012 through 2017, the report says. One section of the report addresses the possibility that Russian intelligence operatives fed disinformation to Steele that ended up in his dossier on Trump. A Justice Department inspector general’s report released Dec. 9 said that the FBI received evidence in early 2017 that Russian operatives may have fed false information into Steele’s network of sources. The Senate committee did find “irrefutable evidence” that the Russian government meddled in the 2016 election, and identified several Russian attempts to cozy up to Trump associates during the campaign and presidential transition period. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, said the report lays out a “a breathtaking level of contacts between Trump officials and Russian government operatives that is a very real counterintelligence threat to our elections.” Perhaps the most eye-catching links laid out in the report are those between former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a former business partner named Konstantin Kilimnik. The report says that Kilimnik is a Russian intelligence officer. The report cites previous reports as well as findings from the special counsel’s investigation that Manafort shared nonpublic information from inside the Trump campaign with Kilimnik, who was also a link between Manafort and Derpiaska, the Russian oligarch. It remains unclear why Manafort provided the information to Kilimnik and whether the Trump campaign was aware of Manafort’s activities. Manafort, fired from the campaign in August 2016, is serving a federal prison sentence on charges related to consulting work he did for Ukraine years before joining the Trump team. The report also details contacts between other Trump associates that Russian operatives may have sought to exploit to influence the campaign. Allegations of blackmail material on Trump, including one central to the Steele dossier, are also addressed in the report. Most of the allegations suggested that Russian operatives were blackmailing Trump with video of him with Russian women. The report does not point to any conclusive evidence that the Kremlin possessed derogatory information on Trump, or that he was ever threatened with exposure. The committee also investigated a June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower in New York City between a group of Russians and Donald Trump Jr., Manafort, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, now a top White House aide. The report says that two of the Russians in the meeting, Rinat Akhmetshin and Natalia Veselnitskaya, likely had ties to the Russian government and Russian intelligence, but that there was no evidence that they provided the campaign with any useful information related to the election. The report notes what long has been reported, that both Akhmetshin and Veselnitskaya worked at the time of the Trump Tower meeting with Simpson, founder of Fusion GPS, the firm that hired Steele. The report says Simpson provided some of the research on a Hillary Clinton donor that Veselnitskaya included in a report that she took into the Trump Tower meeting.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "After two premier college athletics conferences said they’d postpone fall sports including football because of the Covid-19 pandemic, reports say that another still intends to play football this autumn. The Big 12 Conference, following a meeting on Tuesday, still intends to have a fall football season, according to reports from Yahoo! Sports and ESPN. Both outlets cite unnamed sources. When reached by CNN on Tuesday night, a spokesperson for the Big 12 said that details would be announced Wednesday morning. Earlier Tuesday, the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences each voted to postpone college football and all their other fall sports seasons. The ACC and SEC – the two other “Power Five” leagues for football – have yet to declare how they plan to proceed amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said that for his conference, “it became abundantly clear that there was too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks to allow our student-athletes to compete this fall.” “Everyone associated with the Big Ten Conference and its member institutions is committed to getting everyone back to competition as soon as it is safe to do so,” Warren said. University of Michigan Athletic Director Warde Manuel said the conference “will continue to evaluate a number of options” regarding fall sports, “including the possibility of competition in the spring.” The postponement of the 14-team conference’s 2020 football season will put a hold on some of college football’s oldest and most heated rivalries, including “The Game,” an annual November showdown between Michigan and Ohio State. The bitter Big Ten rivals have played 115 times, dating back to the series’ origin in 1897. This fall will mark the first time since 1918 that the Wolverines and Buckeyes won’t battle on the collegiate gridiron. Big Ten football is rooted in long-standing rivalries, each marked by colorful trophies, including Paul Bunyan’s Axe (Minnesota vs. Wisconsin), the Old Oaken Bucket (Indiana vs. Purdue) and the Land of Lincoln Trophy (Illinois vs. Northwestern). With the coronavirus-forced postponement of the season, none of these infamous football fixtures will change hands until at least 2021. The decision to postpone fall sports comes less than a week after the Big Ten announced a restructured 2020 football schedule with a 10th conference game added for all schools amid a season that would extend from as early as September 3 through November 21. “The health, safety and well-being of our student-athletes and all those connected to Pac-12 sports has been our number one priority since the start of this current crisis,” Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. “Our student-athletes, fans, staff and all those who love college sports would like to have seen the season played this calendar year as originally planned, and we know how disappointing this is.” The Pac-12 announcement says competition won’t resume until next year, meaning its basketball teams and other winter sports programs won’t play until 2021. Scott told reporters: “We cannot bubble our student-athletes like pro sports can. We’re part of broader campus communities, student-athletes are living with peer students on campus, interacting.” Not everyone is happy with decision Officials at Nebraska, one of the winningest college football programs, were upset by the move. “We are very disappointed in the decision … as we have been and continue to be ready to play,” the chancellor, university system president, athletic director and football head coach said in a statement.” “Safety comes first,” they said. “Based on the conversations with our medical experts, we continue to strongly believe the absolute safest place for our student athletes is within the rigorous safety protocols, testing procedures, and the structure and support provided by Husker Athletics.” Head coach Scott Frost told the media Monday that the Cornhuskers would explore other options to play this fall if the Big Ten moved or called off the season. “We want to play no matter who it is or where it is. So, we will see how those chips fall,” he said. “We certainly hope it’s in the Big Ten. If it isn’t, I think we are prepared for other options.” Justin Fields, a Heisman Trophy favorite and a quarterback at Ohio State of the Big Ten, tweeted the acronym: “Smh (shaking my head).” President Donald Trump on Tuesday called for teams to take the field. “These are young, strong people,” he said at a White House news conference. “They won’t have a big problem with the China virus. So, we want to see college football start and hopefully a lot of great people are going to be out there, they’re going to be playing football and they’ll be able to fight it off.” Doctors concerned about potential heart complications Dr. Doug Aukerman, the senior associate athletic director for sports medicine at Oregon State, said the decision makers were very concerned with several things. One is that coronavirus is still prevalent in many of the cities where the Pac-12 schools are located. He said the metrics show the pandemic is not well controlled at this time, which is only weeks before the season was to begin. “The other issue is that there is some emerging data about some health risks that affect athletes and, specifically, cardiac side effects of potential Covid infections,” he told reporters. “We don’t know enough about it, so we became more concerned about that.” Dr. Jonathan Drezner, the director of the Center for Sports Cardiology at the University of Washington and a team physician at the school, told CNN’s Brianna Keilar that about a dozen college athletes have gotten myocarditis as a complication from Covid-19. He said in past patients it can lead to scar tissue within the heart. “That scar tissue can be a focus for an arrhythmia or even sudden cardiac arrest,” he said. “And so it’s raised a lot of caution flags. We still have a lot to learn on this. But we’re certainly concerned.” Two big leagues yet to decide Leaders from the “Power Five” conferences met over the weekend to discuss postponing the football season and other fall sports, according to reports from multiple sports news outlets including ESPN, Sports Illustrated and CBS Sports, who all cited several sources. The SEC – college football’s premier top-to-bottom conference – is reportedly actively recruiting other schools to join the league in an effort to proceed with the season. Commissioner Greg Sankey said he wanted to examine the Big Ten and Pac-12 decisions. “I remain comfortable with the thorough and deliberate approach that the SEC and our 14 members are taking to support a healthy environment for our student-athletes,” he said in a statement. “We will continue to further refine our policies and protocols for a safe return to sports as we monitor developments around Covid-19 in a continued effort to support, educate and care for our student-athletes every day.” The ACC on Tuesday said it was pleased with the protocols in place at its 15-member schools but gave no information about whether it is considering postponing any sports. “The ACC will continue to make decisions based on medical advice, inclusive of our Medical Advisory Group, local and state health guidelines, and do so in a way that appropriately coincides with our universities’ academic missions,” the league said. Players unite Over the weekend a collection of players from schools representing all five of college football’s major conferences joined up on a video call to discuss the state of their sport. The result was a statement of unity, calling for better safety and health protocols coupled with a commitment to move forward with the season amid the global pandemic. Trevor Lawrence, another Heisman Trophy frontrunner and quarterback for the top-ranked Clemson Tigers, shared details of the pact on twitter, along with the hashtag #WeWantToPlay. Over the weekend, the Mid-American Conference announced that it was postponing its fall sports schedule due to the coronavirus pandemic, becoming the first conference from NCAA’s top tier Division I Football Bowl Subdivision to postpone its football season. Outside of football, the other fall collegiate sports include men’s and women’s soccer, field hockey, and women’s volleyball. In March, the NCAA canceled what remained of the winter and spring sports seasons. Earlier this month, the NCAA’s Division II and III canceled their fall sports schedules.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Kamala Harris, the politically shrewd California senator with a law enforcement background that has caused some tensions with the progressive left, was announced Tuesday as Joe Biden’s running mate. \"I’ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021,\" Biden said in an email to supporters. She makes history as the first Black woman to serve as a major political party’s VP pick. \"I'm honored to join him as our party's nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief,\" Harris tweeted. The Biden campaign said Biden and Harris will deliver remarks together on Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware. Biden tweeted on Tuesday, \"Back when Kamala was Attorney General, she worked closely with Beau. I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse. I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.\" The decision, following months of secret meetings and closely held deliberations, would indicate the former vice president is setting aside their friction from the primary campaign. Harris memorably drew sharp contrasts with Biden when she challenged him on the debate stage over his past resistance to federally mandated desegregation busing. 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SEN. KAMALA HARRIS Signaling the campaign's line of attack against Harris, President Trump responded by tweeting out an attack ad soon after the announcement that called her “phony Kamala Harris.” The Trump campaign also released a statement from Katrina Pierson, a Trump 2020 senior adviser, that said: \"In her failed attempt at running for president, Kamala Harris gleefully embraced the left’s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders’ government takeover of health care. She is proof that Joe Biden is an empty shell being filled with the extreme agenda of the radicals on the left.” The now-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee’s selection amounts to a vote of confidence in the senator’s political ability and her background, and a willingness to move past the bad blood. The decision may have been tipped days earlier, when he was photographed with talking points saying of Harris that he does “not hold grudges” and has “great respect for her.” The choice also fulfills a commitment the former vice president made in March to name a woman as running mate. Naming a Black woman at a time when issues of racial inequality are front-and-center also responds to signals from some circles in the party that such a choice could help build bridges with the Black community. The timing gives Biden space to re-introduce her to voters ahead of this month’s scaled-back Democratic National Convention. Former President Obama praised the pick. \"Joe Biden nailed this decision,\" Obama said in a statement. \"By choosing Senator Kamala Harris as America’s next vice president, he’s underscored his own judgment and character.\" Biden’s naming of 55-year-old Harris as his running mate comes 13 months after she flattened him on the debate stage in Miami at the first Democratic presidential primary showdown. During the debate, Harris criticized comments by the former vice president spotlighting his ability to find common ground during the 1970s with segregationist senators with whom he disagreed, and his opposition decades ago to federally mandated school busing. “Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America?” Harris asked Biden during the debate. HARRIS TAKES DOWN BIDEN AT FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY DEBATE And in a line that went viral, she spotlighted that “there was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” Biden, who served eight years as vice president to Barack Obama, the first Black president in U.S. history, and who’s enjoyed strong support from African-American voters as he makes his third bid for president, angrily said the senator’s comments were “a mischaracterization” of his position. Biden’s poll numbers briefly edged down after the debate – and Harris enjoyed a short-lived surge in the polls. But her campaign faltered later in the year, and Harris ended her White House bid last December. By the time she suspended her campaign, the relationship between Harris and Biden had improved. Biden has publicly praised Harris numerous times – and has repeatedly pointed out that he’s thought highly of her since she became close to his late son, Beau Biden, when they both served as attorney general of their respective states. Harris ended up endorsing Biden and appeared on stage with him – along with another former rival, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey – at a rally in Michigan on the eve of that state’s March 10 primary, which the former vice president ended up winning decisively as he moved closer to locking up the Democratic nomination. “I believe in Joe. I believe in Joe,” Harris said at the rally. “I know Joe. And that’s why I’m supporting him.” The rally was Biden’s last before the coronavirus pandemic swept across the country, shutting down in-person campaigning. Since then, Harris has campaigned virtually for Biden, headlining online events and fundraisers. While the Harris-Biden feud now seems like ancient history, what may still be relevant is her prosecutorial record as San Francisco district attorney and later as California attorney general. Even before she announced her White House bid in January of last year, Harris’ record as a “progressive prosecutor” was being scrutinized and criticized by some on the left. And that record was in the spotlight at last summer’s second Democratic primary debate in Detroit, as the senator faced withering attacks from Biden and another rival, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. The former vice president accused Harris of keeping nonviolent prisoners behind bars during her tenure as California attorney general because they were a source of cheap labor for the state. “What happened? Along came a federal judge and said enough is enough and he freed 1,000 of these people,” Biden said as he argued that Harris was forced by a judge to release the prisoners. Gabbard also jumped in to land heavy blows – accusing Harris of keeping “people in prison beyond their sentences to use them as cheap labor for the state of California.” While the intra-party rifts from 2019 appear to have healed long ago, the attacks from past primary debates could be used as ammunition by President Trump’s campaign and allied groups to target Biden and Harris. And it remains unclear whether the progressive flank of the party will embrace her. Harris, who was elected to the Senate in 2016, grabbed plenty of attention two years later for her grilling of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh during his contentious confirmation hearings. Harris was a co-sponsor last year of The Green New Deal. As a presidential candidate, she announced her support for the federal legalization of marijuana. The senator was an original co-sponsor of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ single-payer “Medicare-for-all” bill, which if enacted would essentially eliminate private insurance. But she moderated her stance during her nearly year-long White House bid. Harris took a political hit last summer when she introduced a health care plan that allowed for private insurance to co-exist with a government run system. The senator’s called for a national moratorium on the death penalty. And on gun violence, Harris has proposed a ban on importing AR-15-style assault weapons and supported a national buyback program for such weapons. She also said on the campaign trail that if elected president, she would sign executive orders requiring enhanced background checks for weapons purchases if Congress failed to act. Choosing a running mate is arguably the most consequential decision a presidential candidate can make. Biden announced in March during a one-on-one Democratic primary debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders that if he won the nomination, he’d name a woman as his running mate. And the former vice president emphasized for months that he needed to choose a running mate who’s “simpatico with where I am,” pointing to his own strong relationship with former President Obama during their eight years together steering the country. Starting in late May, after the outbreak of protests in cities nationwide over systemic racism sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died while in police custody, the volume was turned up on calls for Biden to name a Black woman as the Democratic Party’s vice presidential nominee. Biden told reporters during a rare news conference at the beginning of July that he had prepared a list of “women of color” for consideration – but he wouldn’t announce a decision until August. Three weeks later he acknowledged that of those he was considering for this running mate, “among them there are four Black women.” The former vice president made his comments during an MSNBC interview. Among the other Black candidates Biden was thought to be considering were Rep. Val Demings of Florida, who is a former Orlando police chief; Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms; former Georgia House leader and 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams; former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. under President Obama Susan Rice; and Rep. Karen Bass of California. Biden was also thought to be considering progressive Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was a Biden rival during the Democratic nomination race; Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin; and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, the first Thai-born woman elected to Congress and an Iraq war veteran who lost both of her legs piloting helicopters in combat. Also believed to be on his list were Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico. Many of the other contenders congratulated Harris on Twitter after the announcement was made. Biden’s naming of his running mate came just several days before the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to kick off on Aug. 17. Then-Sen. Barack Obama named Biden as his running mate just three days before the 2008 Democratic convention. And Donald Trump named then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate three days before the 2016 Republican convention.", "output": "right"}

Carmen Best, the city's first Black police chief, said in a letter to the department that her retirement will be effective September 2, and the mayor has appointed Deputy Chief Adrian Diaz as the interim chief, KING-TV reported Monday. Councilmembers had approved the cuts Monday. \"I am confident the department will make it through these difficult times,\" Best said in the letter. \"You truly are the best police department in the country, and please trust me when I say, the vast majority of people in Seattle support you and appreciate you. ... I look forward to seeing how this department moves forward through the process of re-envisioning public safety. I relish the work that will be done by all of you.\" In an email to police, Mayor Jenny Durkan said she accepted Best's decision \"with a very heavy heart.\" \"I regret deeply that she concluded that the best way to serve the city and help the department was a change in leadership, in the hope that would change the dynamics to move forward with the City Council,\" Durkan wrote. The mayor picked Best to lead the department in July 2018. She had been serving as interim chief. A military veteran, Best joined the department in 1992 and had worked in a wide variety of roles, including patrol, media relations, narcotics and operations and deputy chief. Cuts to the department have been supported by demonstrators who have marched in the city following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, but they were strongly opposed by Durkan and Best. Measures that would cut less than $4 million of the department's $400 million annual budget this year passed out of committee unanimously last week. On Monday, only council member Kshama Sawant voted against the budget package, saying it does not do enough to defund the police. Seattle currently has about 1,400 police officers and the reductions fell far short of the 50% cut to the department that many Black Lives Matter protesters are seeking. Several council members on Monday said the changes were a starting point in a long process to reimagine policing and public safety. The City Council also cut Best's roughly $285,000 annual salary and the pay of other top police leaders, although the final cuts to Best's salary were significantly more modest than those approved last week. The council plan also takes officers off a team that removes homeless camps. \"While we can't do everything in this summer rebalancing package, we have set the path forward for tremendous work in front of us as a council and as a city,\" Council member Teresa Mosqueda said. Durkan and Best had urged the council to slow down its discussions about police budgets, saying the issue could be taken up in earnest when the 2021 city budget is considered. They also said any layoffs would disproportionately target newer officers, often hired from Black and Brown communities, and would inevitably lead to lawsuits. Durkan has proposed cutting about $20 million from the police budget this year largely because of reduced revenues amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, the mayor sketched out a plan to reduce the police budget by about $75 million next year by transferring parking enforcement officers, the 911 call center and other areas out of the department. \"It is unfortunate Council has refused to engage in a collaborative process to work with the mayor, Chief Best, and community members to develop a budget and policies that respond to community needs while accounting for — not just acknowledging — the significant labor and legal implications involved in transforming the Seattle Police Department,\" Durkan said in a statement after the vote.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The White House and a growing number of congressional Republicans support a renewal of the federal evictions moratorium and rental assistance payments in the next economic relief package. The GOP support is due to the fear of a wave of evictions due to the pandemic downturn. The federal evictions moratorium put in place by the CARES Act relief bill in March expired on July 25. Approximately 30-40 million people in the United States are at risk of losing their homes in the next several months without significant federal intervention, according to research released Friday from multiple universities and housing organizations. Furthermore, 29% to 43% of renters could be at risk of eviction by the end of the year. “The need to help tenants is humongous, I think the congressmen recognize if they don’t act soon, there will be a tremendous increase of evictions and homelessness in the coming months,” said Diane Yentel, the National Low Income Housing Coalition president and CEO. Yentel said a dozen Republican senators are in favor of some tenant protections in the next coronavirus spending bill, based on conversations she’s had with them as well as their support for parts of a relevant housing bill. This would likely include an evictions moratorium and some form of rental aid for tenants. Yentel said Republican Sens. Mike Crapo, Rob Portman, Susan Collins, Mike Braun, and Marco Rubio were among the dozen senators in support of tenant protections. Crapo, the Senate banking chairman, confirmed on Tuesday that rental aid is on the table in congressional negotiations over the next package. “Rental assistance needs to be much more focused on those who are impacted by COVID rather than across the board,” Crapo told reporters on Tuesday, adding that he supports the “general approach” of providing assistance. “That may be what we have to do until we figure out the final outlines of a more permanent approach,” Rubio, a Florida Republican, told the Washington Examiner. “Obviously, you have a lot of people out there who would like to go back to work but have no job to go back to. So that may be something we have to do when we figure out what we’re going to do on unemployment,” said Rubio, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Another Republican, Sen. Todd Young from Indiana, is “open to negotiation and would like to see a solution that all stakeholders can agree on,” a spokesperson for Young said. However, the senator has not taken an official position on extending the moratorium yet. Braun, Collins, and Portman did not respond to requests for comment. The Senate Republican package for the next round of coronavirus relief, introduced by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at the end of July, however, does not reinstate the moratorium. Historically, Republicans are in favor of markets operating on their own, with as little government intervention as possible, which is why some in the GOP are likely not in favor of the eviction moratorium, said Salim Furth, an urban economist at George Mason University. Democrats are more willing to entertain intervention. House Democrats passed a bill in May that extends the eviction protections for 12 months from the bill’s enactment for all renters and homeowners. The bill also includes $100 billion for emergency rental assistance to help local governments cover lost revenue for landlords and costs for tenants. The disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on tenant protections is one of many areas of contention between the two parties for the next coronavirus relief package. President Trump is also considering unilateral action to extend enhanced unemployment benefits and eviction protection if a coronavirus deal cannot be reached in Congress. Some housing experts push back against the alarm around evictions, arguing that a boom in evictions is highly unlikely and that the federal government should not play a role even if it does become an issue, suggesting that states take the lead instead. “There’s a really crummy narrative out there with evictions and people throwing stats out which don’t have any real meaning around them in the public discourse,” said Furth. Furth said that although it is technically true that tens of millions of people could get evicted in the coming months, as the NLIHC and others have predicted, in reality, this is highly unlikely, he said, based on current evidence from Princeton University’s Eviction Lab, which tracks evictions across the country. Furth gave the example of hundreds of millions of people potentially dying every day from driving a car as a parallel to the eviction narrative. The risk of mass evictions exists, and during a pandemic, anything is possible, Furth said, but a massive wave of evictions is unlikely even without an eviction moratorium. He added that an eviction moratorium would just kick the problems down the road by forcing tenants to pay their rent or negotiate with their landlords at the end of the moratorium. State and local governments, not the federal government, can play a role in helping tenants and landlords to negotiate better, fairer housing contracts during this period of pandemic-induced economic uncertainty, Furth said. Tenant advocates say leaving tenant rights to the states instead of the federal government is a “patchwork solution” that leaves renters in many states without protections. This also puts the burden on low-income renters to know and figure out if they’re protected against evictions, Yentel added. Even though most landlords are against an eviction moratorium, Furth said, evictions are not desirable for landlords or tenants in most situations. Finding new tenants is always challenging and even more so during a pandemic. One area where tenants and landlords agree is their support of government rental assistance to help renters pay off their missed payments, said Yentel. Expanded unemployment benefits from the federal government can also help alleviate this problem.", "output": "right"}

One sticking point: It’s already guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act — which his administration is fighting to kill in the Supreme Court. “Over the next two weeks I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers,” Trump crowed at a news conference Friday at his Bedminster golf resort in New Jersey. “That’s a big thing. I’ve always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover preexisting conditions.” The news was so “major” that it was touted in an official White House tweet. Trump claimed it’s “never been done before.” But it has been done before. Health insurance companies have been required to cover people with preexisting conditions ever since the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was enacted 10 years ago. To put an extra head spin on the whole incident, Trump’s Department of Justice argued before the Supreme Court in June to shut down the ACA with its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. It even specifically singled out coverage for preexisting conditions as something that’s got to go. If the action against Obamacare by Trump’s DOJ succeeds, some 20 million Americans would lose their health insurance amid the COVID-19 crisis. CNN’s Chris Cuomo slammed Trump’s vow as a “dangerous lie.” Coverage for preexisting conditions is “already the law of the land,” he said. Now, “not only is he lying to you about giving you something you already have, he’s actively trying to take it away,” Cuomo added. Twitter went bonkers over Trump’s announcement.", "output": "left"}

(AP) — About 200 people, some wielding homemade shields, clashed with police early Friday for the third consecutive night as two other Black Lives Matter rallies proceeded peacefully elsewhere in the city, authorities said. The demonstration with unrest came hours after the city’s Democratic mayor pleaded for protesters to stay off the streets, saying those who barricaded the doors to a police precinct the night before and tried to set it ablaze were not demonstrators, but criminals. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the violent protesters are also serving as political “props” for President Donald Trump in a divisive election-season where the president is hammering on a law-and-order message. Trump has tried to portray the protesters as “sick and dangerous anarchists” running wild in the city’s streets. The chaos that started Thursday night and lasted into Friday morning in a residential neighborhood about six miles (10 kilometers) from downtown marked the 70th night of unrest since May 25, following the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis. Police arrested 12 adults and detained one 17-year-old on suspicion of charges ranging from interfering with a police officer to rioting. The demonstrations this week are noticeably smaller than the crowds of thousands who turned out nightly for about two weeks in July to protest the presence of U.S. agents sent by the Trump administration to protect a federal courthouse that had become a target of nightly violence. This week’s clashes nevertheless ratcheted up tensions after an agreement last week between state and federal officials seemed to offer a brief reprieve. The deal brokered by Democratic Gov. Kate Brown called for agents from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Marshals Service and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to pull back from their defense of the Mark O. Hatfield Federal Courthouse starting July 30. Early Friday, as peaceful demonstrations proceeded elsewhere in the city, a group of people gathered at a park in eastern Portland and marched to the local police precinct, where authorities say they spray-painted the building, popped the tires of police cars, splashed paint on the walls, vandalized security cameras and set a fire in a barrel outside the building. One officer was severely injured by a rock, police said, but no additional details were provided. An older woman who tried to stop the vandalism was hit with a bucket of white paint and then got into a shouting match with those in the crowd as one protester tried to wrap her in yellow police tape — a conflict caught on video. Another elderly woman using a walker was also captured on video trying to put out a fire with a fire extinguisher while a black-clad protester blocked her way. Tear gas was used by police on protesters Wednesday for the first time since the U.S. agents left the city, but officers did not use it Thursday despite declaring the demonstration an unlawful assembly. Wheeler, who was tear-gassed several weeks ago with protesters as he stood with them outside the federal courthouse, warned the demonstrators Thursday that their actions are helping Trump. “Don’t think for a moment that if you are participating in this activity, you are not being a prop for the reelection campaign of Donald Trump — because you absolutely are,” he said. “If you don’t want to be part of that, then don’t show up.” The Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front, which advertised the rallies Wednesday and Thursday on social media, used Twitter to announce the events with the slogan “No cops. No prisons. Total abolition.” The group, which described itself as a “decentralized network of autonomous youth collectives dedicated to direct action towards total liberation,” did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Wheeler said the city anticipates more such events through the weekend. Portland police have arrested more than 400 people at protests since late May. U.S. agents arrested at least an additional 94 people during protests at the federal courthouse in July. ____ Follow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus", "output": "left"}

Ron DeSantis (R) before the case went to trial. The Florida Secretary of State, Laurel Lee, will educate and encourage county supervisors with vote by mail procedures, including the use of drop boxes for ballots, prepaid postage, and providing vote-by-mail request forms in Spanish. Florida voters still have to request a ballot to vote by mail. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Tuesday that Trump was fine with absentee voting, but not mass mailings of ballots to voters. “The president has always said that absentee voting for a reason is different than mass mailout voting like what Nevada is seeking to do which leads to mass fraud,” McEnany said, referring to recent legislation passed in an emergency session of Nevada’s state legislature. Nevada will send ballots to all of the state’s active voters for the 2020 election and even allow other people to fill out ballots for the elderly and disabled. On Monday, Trump said in Florida that he approved of absentee ballots because it was part of a more secure process. “Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they’ll do absentee. It really works,” Trump said. “But universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country.”", "output": "right"}

Diab said it was \"unacceptable\" that a shipment of ammonium nitrate estimated at 2,750 tons had been in warehouse for six years without \"preventive measures\" to protect it. The chemical compound, which is commercially available, is used widely in fertilizers and explosives. It wasn't clear what ignited the shipment, but at least 4,000 people were injured and 100 others were killed, the secretary-general of the Lebanese Red Cross, George Kettana, told Lebanese broadcaster LBCI on Wednesday. The number of casualties could rise — some of the injuries are serious and some people are still trapped under rubble, Kettana said. Images and videos on social media appear to show large plumes of smoke and damaged buildings. The head of Lebanon's general security agency, Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, who toured the Beirut port to inspect the damage, said: \"It is not possible to pre-empt investigations and say that there was a terrorist act.\" Speaking during a coronavirus task force briefing Tuesday, President Donald Trump said the explosion looked \"like a terrible attack,\" although he offered no evidence and said later that the conclusion was based on the presumptions of U.S. generals. \"This was not a, some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event,\" Trump said. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that wheat was being stored in a nearby warehouse. Firetrucks rushed to the scene, and evacuation operations were underway, it said. Military and security personnel were also on the scene to ease traffic to make way for emergency vehicles. The Lebanese Red Cross confirmed on Twitter that it had more than 30 teams, including ambulances, responding to the blast and had put out an urgent call for blood donations. Lebanese President Michel Aoun said on Twitter that the Public Health Ministry would meet the expenses of treating the wounded and that the government would provide shelter and support to displaced families whose properties were damaged. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian offered condolences and said France was ready to assist its former colony. 'Lots of destruction' Video from the Beirut offices of the Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper, appears to show fallen-in parts of the roof, blown-out windows and damaged furniture, indicating the strength of the blast. Hours later, the U.S. Embassy warned of toxic gases and told people to stay indoors and wear masks. An NBC News journalist in the city felt the explosion from her apartment, more than a kilometer from the port, as her windows and doors were blown out, filling the stairwell with thick dust as residents dashed to exit the building. Dozens of residents people, some covered in blood, scrambled to their cars to leave the area for the safety of nearby mountains. \"It's like Hiroshima,\" Beirut Mayor Jamal Itani told reporters. \"There is lots of destruction, and the wounded are lying in the streets.\" Another NBC News journalist said the blast was \"colossal\" and that it could be felt miles away as it rippled through the capital, leaving a trail of destruction behind. In an interview, Aly Sleem, 34, who was driving in a neighborhood near the explosion, said he heard what sounded like two blasts. \"The second one was really horrible,\" he said. \"You couldn't even breathe.\" A journalist who recorded the secondary explosion, Ahmad Yassine, 30, captured what appeared to be a mushroom cloud rising from the building. Yassine was having lunch a few kilometers away at the time, and in a video he tweeted, a loud blast followed by screams can be heard moments after the cloud dissipates. At first, Yassine said in an interview, he didn't know whether he was still breathing. \"Later on, I saw people running, destruction, glass everywhere,\" he said. After the sun set, parts of the city remained without power, said Joelle Bassoul, a regional content manager for Amnesty International. \"It's completely dark behind me,\" she said. \"It's completely silent.\" Bassoul, a former journalist who covered the country's civil war from 1975 to 2000, said the \"sheer scale of fear and panic\" she saw in the streets reminded of her that period. \"It's just scenes of devastation tonight,\" she said. Officials still inspecting the site The National News Agency reported that Diab, the prime minister, and other ministers were inspecting damage at the site. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said it wasn't clear whether any Americans were killed or injured. \"Having witnessed the horrific explosions at the Port this evening, our heartfelt sympathies go out to the victims and their families,\" U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea said in a statement. \"We mourn each loss from this terrible tragedy alongside the Lebanese people.\" Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told a local television channel that it was too early to speculate on the cause and that there was no reason to believe the explosion was not an accident. Blast comes as Lebanon contends with other crises Lebanon is in the midst of a number of social and political crises. The country is bracing for a U.N.-backed court to deliver a verdict Friday on the death of Rafik Hariri, the prime minister who was killed by a truck bomb in 2005, sending the country's fragile political system into turmoil. It is also grappling with the coronavirus pandemic and a spiraling economic crisis, the most severe in its modern history, that has pushed many Lebanese people to protest in the streets this year as unemployment has soared.

Interviewer Jonathan Swan repeatedly challenged Trump on topics ranging from the increasing number of coronavirus cases when he held his indoor and largely maskless rally in Tulsa, Okla., to Afghanistan to mail-in voting. Swan also asked Trump his opinion of Lewis. \"John Lewis is lying in state at the U.S. Capitol. How do you think history will remember John Lewis?\" Swan asked Trump.

The dueling statements were another twist in the increasingly fractious communications between local and federal officials about the violence in Portland. In a series of tweets Wednesday morning, Brown said that the Trump administration had \"agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland\" starting Thursday and that security of downtown would be left to \"our local Oregon State Police officers.\" But in a statement issued around the same time, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said his department \"will continue to maintain our current, augmented federal law enforcement personnel in Portland until we are assured that the Hatfield Federal Courthouse and other federal properties will no longer be attacked and that the seat of justice in Portland will remain secure.\" \"The Department will continue to re-evaluate our security posture in Portland, and should circumstances on the ground significantly improve due to the influx of state and local law enforcement, we anticipate the ability to change our force posture,\" Wolf added.

President Donald Trump claimed on Twitter earlier that Portland would have been \"burned and beaten to the ground\" without the presence of federal officers, and he vowed to have the \"federal government go in and do the job\" if \"the Mayor and Governor do not stop the Crime and Violence.\" Protests in Portland have been going on for two months, but the situation intensified when federal agents — from the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Marshals Service — were deployed beginning the weekend of July 4. Since then, agents have used tear gas and pepper spray and have shot \"less lethal\" munitions, at times indiscriminately, into crowds. The city had its largest turnout of the protests last weekend as around 5,000 people gathered in front of and around the Mark O. Hatfield U.S. Courthouse, which has been heavily guarded by federal agents. As of Wednesday, at least 114 federal officers were known to be in the city, according to a court filing by the government.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Coronavirus relief: GOP caught between ideals and economic reality Loading... | Washington As the economy approaches a daunting cliff of expiring coronavirus relief programs, House Democrats have already responded by passing an economic rescue bill that’s even bigger than the first. Republicans are exhibiting a very different mindset – espousing the view that, despite the urgency of the moment, it’s better not to rush in spending such large sums of taxpayer money. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argued for a “pause” back in May, and on Monday he defended that cautious approach, even as his party proposed a roughly $1 trillion plan to offer new aid to struggling Americans and an ailing economy. House Democrats, with their HEROES Act, would spend another $3 trillion. On Tuesday, they painted GOP senators as harming the economy with their slowness to act. Why We Wrote This Both parties say it’s urgent for the federal government to continue propping up businesses and average Americans with a new relief bill. But rifts over the size of the package – and which elements are most critical – remain. Editor’s note: As a public service, all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall. The gap is rooted heavily in ideology. Republicans have traditionally been a party of economic individualism, not big government. Some GOP senators would rather pass no bill than what they view as a profligate one. In the end, however, pragmatism and politics are likely to bring the two sides toward a compromise as they negotiate a relief package that, judging by economic data, is acutely needed. Whether one views Senate Republicans as a useful check against liberal excess or a source of needless delay and parsimony, conservative lawmakers appear poised to play a pivotal role in the next policy steps at a critical time for the economy. “The strategy of the Democrats is ‘bigger is better,’ and that we need to aim a Keynesian bazooka at the economy in order to get it going,” says Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute. “By contrast, Republicans are taking the approach that we need targeted social insurance to keep businesses and families afloat ... but that we want to do this without spending anything beyond what is necessary.” The Republican plan still includes everything from new “economic impact” checks for households to money for school systems and for coronavirus testing and vaccines. Among the sources of disagreement with Democrats: Republicans want to be less generous in providing extra assistance for unemployed people, and more generous toward businesses by shielding them from potential lawsuits over the COVID-19 disease. “This is not free money,” said GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, last Thursday. “In the end, someone is going to pay taxes for this.” Whatever Congress does, it’s important to make sure the investment of taxpayer dollars gets “a return,” Senator Scott said, in an interview outside the Senate chamber. For him, shielding businesses from liability is key to aiding an economic recovery, as are funds for coronavirus testing. “Congress should absolutely spend what it takes” Even for disciples of John Maynard Keynes – the British economist who pioneered the idea that government spending could lift economies out of recession – it’s clear that pouring in federal dollars is at best a partial fix for the economy’s current troubles. Without progress toward getting the coronavirus pandemic under control, restoring normal activity for consumers and businesses is unrealistic. Yet that doesn’t mean the next round of federal relief isn’t critical. Already about 30 million Americans are relying on unemployment benefits, which are poised to diminish after this week with the expiration of a special boost enacted by Congress in March. Similarly, safeguards against tenant evictions during the pandemic emergency have expired recently at the federal level and in some states. Emergency loans to businesses – also dating from the $2.2 trillion CARES Act in March – are fading as a prop-up to help pandemic-affected employers. By some recent indicators, businesses are increasingly feeling unable to survive the long wait for a rebound, and job losses are shifting from temporary to permanent. Mr. Riedl, while generally sharing the conservative instinct against big spending, says the riskiest move right now would be for government to give too little help, not too much. And time is of the essence. “We’re already seeing reports of restaurants closing permanently in large numbers,” he says. “The cost of the [Paycheck Protection Program loans] or related business assistance programs is significantly cheaper than the cost of millions of businesses going under, keeping the unemployment rate high, and prolonging the downturn several years. Congress should absolutely spend what it takes to keep businesses afloat.” Negotiations with Democrats over a final bill that both the House and Senate can approve (and the president sign) may last into early August. But in the end, Republicans who control the Senate have a powerful motive to strike a deal. Failing to act would be a big election-year liability, at a time when the economy is operating far below its capacity and the pandemic is not contained. “The longer Congress negotiates what our next [relief bill] will look like, the longer American families are suffering, the longer American business is hurting, and the longer we are delaying our economic vibrancy in this country,” says C. LeRoy Cavazos-Reyna, vice president of government affairs at the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. That reality is pushing the two sides toward common ground. Both sides want to help schools operate amid the budget squeeze, and to address the pandemic itself. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Monday his party is ready to spend billions to support production of vaccines – even if some of that money is wasted on vaccines that prove ineffective. The idea: having a successful vaccine ready for public use in January rather than next May “is worth billions of dollars” more to the economy. And both sides know that businesses need additional help. Some senators in both parties support not only a new round of loans for hard-hit small businesses, but also making additional investment money available to firms in distressed neighborhoods across the country. Speaking in a corrective tone toward some members of his own party, GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said Monday that business loans are “not a bailout. This is about viable companies who are struggling because of necessary government regulations.” Partisan rifts to be overcome Yet alongside likely points of bipartisan agreement are partisan rifts to be overcome. How much aid do states and cities need? Should the bill include Democratic priorities like stepped-up nutrition assistance, more relief from eviction, and hazard pay for essential workers during the pandemic? Where to draw a line of compromise on the overall size of the package? The most publicized divide – and one that puts the parties’ ideological differences in sharp relief – is over unemployment benefits. Republicans are resisting an extension of the $600-per-week CARES Act supplement to the regular unemployment insurance that states offer. They argue that, with many people getting more income while jobless than they did working, it’s a disincentive to return to jobs. Their proposal: Replace 70% of income for the unemployed, and offer a new hiring bonus for people who go back to work. Since some states are unable, administratively, to implement relief as a percentage of lost income, the GOP plan would temporarily offer a flat federal supplement again, but at $200 per week rather than $600. To supporters, this proposal still offers bolstered aid to the unemployed during a time of emergency, while also hewing to the conservative ideal of promoting individual responsibility. “It just wouldn’t be fair to use taxpayer dollars to pay more people to sit home,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a TV appearance Sunday. But critics of the proposal say generosity toward the jobless is warranted on both economic grounds and out of justice toward individuals. “There’s a sort of basic question of fairness here,” says Ernie Tedeschi, a former U.S. Treasury economist now at the strategic advisory firm Evercore ISI. “These people are not able to work and not able to make money because we had, in many cases, shut down their places of business to control a pandemic. So it just seems fair to me that those families should be made entirely whole.” As for the economy, he sees little evidence that generous benefits are harming the labor market. Job seekers far outnumber available jobs, and “if we withdraw it too early, we really run the risk of a pretty serious self-inflicted wound on the U.S. recovery,” by undercutting consumer spending, Mr. Tedeschi says. Although the Hispanic Chamber hasn’t taken a stand in the debate over jobless benefits, Mr. Cavazos-Reyna notes that the stakes are particularly high for Latino and Black Americans. “Latinos and African Americans are some of the hardest hit populations in this country health-wise when you look at the pandemic, and hitting them again economically would just be disastrous,” he says. Susan Dawson, board chair-elect at the National Association of Women Business Owners, says the CARES Act in general failed to bring a fair share of relief to minority populations and women. In her view, a top economic priority – once safety allows – is reopening schools, not just for the sake of kids but also for parents who are straddling roles as remote workers and caregivers. “I suddenly went from not just a full-time working business owner but also having to suddenly learn how to be a teacher to some degree,” she says. Like Mr. Cavazos-Reyna, Ms. Dawson has been hearing from business owners about their need for loans and other relief – and the sooner a bipartisan deal can be reached, the better. Many economists, while acknowledging that deficits could become a future drag on economic growth, say the top priority now should be clear to both parties. “We know the pandemic is having a sharp and persistently negative effect on household income and the American economy right now,” Mr. Tedeschi says. “That should be our priority.” Staff writer Noah Robertson contributed to this report.", "output": "center"}

GOP leaders and the White House said late Wednesday that they had agreed on key parts of the legislation, which will serve as a starting point for negotiations with Democrats, who have already passed their own bill in the House. But Republicans are still struggling to put the finishing touches on the package. Congress and the White House are under pressure to clinch a deal on a fresh pandemic aid package; a federal program of expanded unemployment benefits is set to run out within days. One item that will be missing from the GOP plan is President Donald Trump’s demand for a payroll tax cut. Republicans abandoned that proposal even though Trump had suggested he might not sign any bill that doesn’t include it. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters that a payroll tax cut will not be included in the bill because the focus is getting money to workers quickly. \"The payroll tax takes time,\" he said. Trump said on Twitter that Republicans abandoned the payroll tax cut because of objections from Democrats. \"The Democrats have stated strongly that they won’t approve a Payroll Tax Cut (too bad!),\" he wrote. \"It would be great for workers. The Republicans, therefore, didn’t want to ask for it. Dems, as usual, are hurting the working men and women of our Country!\" More stimulus checks?: Many Americans might not get another relief check. Here's where things stand on another COVID-19 bill The Republican relief package comes as the U.S. continues to reel from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 143,000 Americans and wreaked havoc on the economy. The Labor Department reported Thursday that the number of Americans filing jobless claims rose for the first time since March as 1.4 million people filed for unemployment claims. GOP leaders hoped to release the package on Thursday. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Trump administration requested additional time to review the details. The proposal will be unveiled early next week, he said. \"We have an agreement in principle on the shape of this package,\" McConnell said. Democrats immediately slammed the GOP package, saying it doesn't go far enough to counter the effects of the pandemic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the proposal \"doesn't reconcile with the needs of the American people.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it \"unsatisfactory and fundamentally unserious.\" The Republican legislation will include a limited extension of unemployment benefits, Mnuchin told reporters on Capitol Hill. An extra $600 unemployed Americans receive on top of their weekly benefits is set to run out at the end of the month. Mnuchin said the GOP plan would extend those supplemental benefits but not at the current level. The supplemental benefit will be restructured so that instead of a $600 flat rate, a new formula would be used to replace 70% of a worker's lost wages through combined state and federal benefits. That would lower the federal benefit to about $200 a week for the average worker. \"We realize there are a lot of hardworking Americans who, because of COVID, still won't have jobs, and we do not want that to expire,\" Mnuchin said. \"On the other hand, we've said we were in a different situation last time.\" Some Republicans argued the extra $600 was a disincentive for some Americans to return to work because they were earning more through unemployment than through their job. Jettisoning the $600 benefit for a new 70% wage replacement formula is an attempt to address those concerns. The relief package will be rolled out in separate pieces of legislation instead of one comprehensive bill. Because the unemployment benefits will expire at the end of the month, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the Senate may have to take that up first, along with school funding, then deal with the other issues later. Pelosi and other Democrats immediately rejected that approach. \"No. No, no,\" Pelosi said. \"We cannot piecemeal this.\" Though many details of the GOP proposal still must be worked out, it is expected to provide $70 billion in new funding for elementary and secondary schools. Half will be distributed on a per capita basis, and the rest will be awarded to schools that reopen this fall. Mnuchin said the package also will include $16 billion in new coronavirus testing, additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, tax credits to encourage companies to hire workers and another round of direct payments to individuals. The GOP proposal for more direct payments has \"the exact same provisions as last time,\" when $1,200 stimulus checks were sent to individuals earning $75,000 or less a year, Mnuchin said. Since the coronavirus outbreak first hit the U.S., Congress and the White House have approved more than $3 trillion in aid, passing a series of bills that provided loans and grants to businesses hurt by the pandemic, stimulus checks to Americans, expanded unemployment for laid-off workers and money for increased testing and vaccine research. For this round, House Democrats passed a $3 trillion bill in May that includes an extension of the $600 increase in unemployment benefits, a second $1,200 stimulus check for individuals and families, about $1 trillion for state and local governments, additional worker protections and more money for testing and contact tracing. McConnell dismissed the House bill as \"a nonstarter\" and said Republicans would come up with their own plan. Contributing: Christal Hayes Michael Collins covers the White House.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters Thursday the Republican plan to reduce enhanced unemployment benefits is unacceptable and the overall $1 trillion price tag of the GOP proposal falls far short of what is needed to combat the virus and its economic impact. “They are engaged in distortions, delays, and denial,” said Pelosi, a California Democrat. “It’s very damaging to our economy, very deadly to our people.” Democrats said they would not accept a piecemeal approach to a new round of federal funding and suggested they would not support a temporary stand-alone extension of unemployment insurance enhancements that expire this month. “No way,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. “This is a comprehensive proposal that addresses the many problems of COVID, and we have to address it as a totality.” Senate Republicans are preparing to release a $1 trillion package that includes funding for education and testing, as well as new direct payments to people and families. The measure is also expected to extend expanded unemployment benefits, but the GOP is determined to reduce the benefit from the current $600-per-week level because it pays many workers more to stay home than to return to their jobs. But Democrats say they don’t want to reduce the amount and accused the GOP of caring more about corporate interests than struggling unemployed workers. Democrats want the GOP to take up a House-passed $3 trillion coronavirus aid package they call the Heroes Act because it provides hazard pay for frontline workers, among many other expenditures. The House bill would extend unemployment insurance benefits at the current $600-per-week level. “I go to the table with the commitment for the $600,” Pelosi said. “Why are they worried about whether it’s 600 or 400 or 500? People really need that.” Senate Republicans met Thursday morning with Trump administration officials to continue hammering out a deal. Lawmakers said they are close to releasing a measure, but Democrats are playing up internal party divisions over the size and scope of the measure. Democrats said the GOP is in disarray over the $1 trillion proposal, which has led to a delay in a bipartisan deal. “They are so divided,” Schumer said. “And there’s no leadership from the president. And he doesn’t know how to solve this problem. So much of the illness and so much of the deaths and so much of the economic hardship and health hardship is because this administration has no direction, no plan.

His visit ended with his security detail engaging in a struggle with protesters late Wednesday night as they worked to get the mayor to safety, a report said. Earlier, he moved with protesters to the fence outside of the federal courthouse where he stood at the front and was tear-gassed along with the crowd, according to New York Times correspondent Mike Baker. Wheeler called the tear-gassing an \"egregious overreaction,\" telling Baker he didn't see anything in the crowd that warranted the reaction by federal officers. \"This is not a de-escalation strategy,\" he said. \"This is flat-out urban warfare and it's being brought on this country by the president and it's got to stop now.\" PORTLAND BANS POLICE FROM WORKING WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT As Wheeler left, a few protesters following him tried to push against his security team once he had entered a building. Others threw water bottles and other projectiles at the glass door, according to Baker. Portland's City Council passed new policies on Wednesday that immediately bans all police bureau members from working with federal law enforcement and prevents them from intentionally arresting or using force on journalists and legal observers. Wheeler had joined protesters downtown earlier in the evening for a listening session where he thanked them for opposing the Trump administration’s “occupation” of the city in the deployment of federal agents. \"I think what we're doing tonight is actually the best thing we can do right now,\" Wheeler told hundreds in the crowd after a protester asked how to get federal officers out of the city, according to KGW-TV. \"Be here, be heard, be unified, and be clear. We didn't want them, we didn't ask for them, they're not trained for what they're being asked to do. And we want them to leave.\" Wheeler, who has repeatedly said he opposes the deployment of federal officers to the city, was nearly drowned out by shouts and jeers and calls to resign and was loudly booed when he told a protester that he didn’t support abolishing the police department. He then addressed a much larger crowd from a raised balcony, saying “I am here tonight to stand with you.” He received some cheers when he chanted “Black lives matter!” with the crowd. Some protesters also threw fireworks at the courthouse and tried to knock down the fencing erected outside.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "President Trump and Senate Republicans are beginning negotiations with House Democrats on a new round of pandemic fiscal relief. Here are some of the major policies under consideration: Payroll tax cut Trump strongly supports providing a payroll tax cut to workers and their employers, but the proposal is not popular with Senate Republicans or Democrats. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows met with Senate Republicans on Tuesday and said the president is committed to including the payroll tax cut in the next relief bill despite the opposition in the Senate. Republican John Cornyn of Texas, who advises Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, said inclusion of the proposal would be “problematic.” Democrats also don’t support the measure. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden from Oregon last week said the tax cut would benefit people who have jobs instead of helping those who are out of work. “A payroll tax cut would do nothing to help the 20 million workers who have lost their jobs and little for those working significantly reduced hours,” he said. The measure would also get bipartisan pushback in the House, according to a senior Democratic aide. “There is bipartisan consensus that a payroll tax cut is not the most effective way to provide relief,” the aide told the Washington Examiner. $600 enhanced unemployment payments A major question looming over talks about fiscal relief is the fate of the $600 enhanced unemployment benefit that expires at the end of this month. McConnell has publicly stated that he will not extend the $600 payment in the next relief bill, but the White House supports extending the program at a lower amount. “We’re going to make sure that we don’t pay people more money to stay home than go to work,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday. The $600 payment has come under fire by Republican lawmakers because many workers who receive it get more from unemployment than they did at their prior job. On average, unemployment benefits across the country were $385 per week in February 2020, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. When combined with the added benefit, jobless workers receive nearly $1,000 a week. The median salary for a grocery store cashier, an essential worker, is roughly $600 a week, according to Salary.com. The White House would like to see the payment reduced to between $200 and $400, but it is not clear whether McConnell would support the provision at a lower payout. House Democrats passed legislation extending the $600 payment through January of next year. However, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, last week signaled a willingness to be flexible on the payment amount. Its size could be reduced if the finalized bill includes direct stimulus payments to individuals and families, according to the speaker. State aid Democrats are eager to help states and cities, which have seen their budgets crushed by the pandemic, and face the prospect of mass layoffs of public workers. The Republican Senate is not expected to include additional aid to state and local governments in its next relief bill. Senate Republicans are concerned that state and local governments might use the money for non-virus issues, such as shoring up pension funds. Trump, however, endorsed the idea of more relief last month. “We’re set up to do more if we want. I think we should because we are dominant,” he said at the White House. Vice President Mike Pence in June said that the White House is open to providing aid to state and local governments in the next relief package as long as the funding goes to coronavirus-related expenses. Without additional aid, 4 million jobs could be lost, according to a June report by Moody’s Analytics. House Democrats approved nearly $1 trillion in state and local aid in the bill they passed in May. Moody’s states that this dollar figure is too high and projects that $500 billion in aid would be required. It also warns that doing nothing could shave 3% off of real GDP on an annual basis. Testing McConnell said on Tuesday that his legislation would provide funds for additional testing, but he did not disclose the amount. The Senate proposal is very different from what the administration wants, which is to cut or totally eliminate the funds for testing. Trump doesn’t want to provide more funding because states have yet to spend all the money allocated for testing in the CARES Act, which was enacted in March. Also, Trump said additional testing would be “creating trouble” because the number of cases would likely increase in an interview with Fox News on Sunday. Trump used his speech in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 20 to call for reductions in testing. Trump will have a hard time forcing his position on this issue since the House in May approved $75 billion for testing, contact tracing, and isolation measures for people infected by the disease and forced into quarantine. Some GOP senators have reportedly been angered by Trump wanting to erase funds for testing and are pushing to ensure that the money stays in the bill. Relief checks McConnell, on Tuesday, said his bill would include stimulus checks, but he did not say who would be eligible for them. In the past, the majority leader has said his bill would provide a stimulus payment to people earning under $40,000. This figure is less than what was approved as part of the CARES Act in March. That package provided a one-time $1,200 payment for people who earned up to $75,000. Those earning more than this amount received a partial payment, which phased out at $99,000. Trump has recently remarked that he is open to another round of stimulus payments. Democrats also support such payments and included in their bill that passed their chamber in May a $1,200 stimulus payment to individuals that topped at $6,000 for households. Of all the differing positions between the White House, Senate, and House, this provision appears to be the easiest to settle since all three agree on providing some level of payment to individuals. Liability protections McConnell is expected to include a five-year liability shield for businesses in his bill. The measure would protect businesses, hospitals, and schools from lawsuits related to the coronavirus. It is expected to be narrowly focused to weed out establishments that act negligently from being protected. The coverage would begin in December of 2019 and last through 2024. The president supports McConnell’s proposal. Democrats do not. The Republican Senate and Democratic House don’t have a lot of time to reach a bicameral agreement on the next relief bill. Both chambers are bumping up against a monthlong break, with the House scheduled to leave town on July 31 and the Senate on Aug. 7.", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Donald Trump’s new memorandum to exclude undocumented immigrants from the next round of congressional apportionment is morally repulsive, illegal, and impossible. It is repulsive because it borrows the logic of the notorious Three-Fifths Clause to declare that undocumented immigrants are not full “persons” under the Constitution. It is illegal because it seeks to exclude these immigrants from a state’s population when counting how many seats each state gets in the House of Representatives, which violates the Constitution. And it is impossible because there is no way that the government can count undocumented immigrants with any accuracy by the December deadline. None of these problems will stop Trump from trying to rig the census to strip House seats from states with large undocumented populations. Even if this scheme fails, however, the memo will do insidious damage to the bedrock principle that all people count. Trump has formally endorsed the notion of excluding noncitizens from the redistricting process, an idea that red states are already exploring to boost the electoral power of white, rural voters at the cost of diverse urban centers. Trump’s census order, released on Tuesday, is not actually an order at all but a “memorandum” that announces “the policy of the United States” (i.e., the Trump administration). It attempts to revert back to the pre–Civil War practice of diminishing the constitutional personhood of certain residents. Originally, the Constitution counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person when apportioning House seats. The 14th Amendment repealed this Three-Fifths Clause by stating that representatives “shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.” House seats would now be apportioned on the basis of “persons” living in each state. There would be no more degrading distinctions on the basis of legal status. Ever since, Congress has counted all “persons,” meaning a state’s “inhabitants,” another term used in the 14th Amendment. Trump wants to disrupt this historical practice by decreeing that undocumented immigrants are not “persons” under the 14th Amendment. In other words, he wants to import the racist logic of the Three-Fifths Clause into an amendment designed to abolish that very principle. On what legal basis? Trump provides two arguments. First, he equates undocumented immigrants with diplomats, tourists, and businessmen. Because these individuals are only visiting the U.S., they are not deemed “inhabitants” and thus excluded from the census. But a large majority of undocumented immigrants cannot be considered foreign tourists on a temporary jaunt through America. They live here, put down roots, and often raise children who are citizens. They are members of their communities with an established presence in the country. To dismiss them as non-inhabitants—and, by extension, not “whole … persons”—would run counter to the 14th Amendment. Second, Trump presents a policy argument thinly disguised as a legal claim. “Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status,” his memo states, would “create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law.” States that adopt so-called sanctuary laws to protect undocumented immigrants “should not be rewarded with greater representation in the House of Representatives.” And excluding these immigrants from the census count “is more consonant with the principles of representative democracy,” because states with more citizens deserve more “formal political influence.” This logic transforms a constitutional command into a tool of partisan manipulation. In Trump’s view, the executive gets to decide who is and is not a “person” based on “principles of representative democracy.” If certain people deserve less “political influence,” they can be excluded from the count with a wave of the president’s magic wand. Moreover, the executive can punish states that pass laws he dislikes by refusing to count some of their residents, diminishing their congressional representation. This view is not the law, or anything close to it. No court has ever allowed the government to exclude an entire class of inhabitants from the census count based on a president’s idiosyncratic conception of who is a “person.” Yet an even bigger logistical problem looms over this endeavor: The government does not know how many undocumented immigrants live in each state and has no way to find out. Trump notoriously tried to count noncitizens on the 2020 census, but the Supreme Court blocked the question. He then tried to tally noncitizens by drawing on existing records, but the process has floundered: Only four states have turned over citizenship data to the federal government. And states do not track the number of undocumented immigrants within their borders, so even if Trump could tally all noncitizens, he could not identify which are authorized to live here. By law, Trump must turn over census apportionment data to Congress within a week of Jan. 3, 2021. How does he intend to come up with nonexistent citizenship data in less than six months? The memo does not explain. And here’s where things get messy. The Constitution grants Congress power over the census and congressional apportionment. Congress has delegated most of those responsibilities to the executive branch. Under current law, the president reports census apportionment data to Congress, then the clerk or sergeant at arms of the House of Representatives certifies the information and sends it to state governors. Presuming Democrats retain control of the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi could direct the clerk or sergeant at arms not to certify Trump’s data. And if Joe Biden beats Trump, he could withdraw Trump’s report, replacing it with an accurate, constitutional count. Before this potential showdown, though, the Trump administration will be sued. States with large undocumented populations like California—which the president is trying to punish by reducing their congressional representation—will probably join the legal pile-on. It seems unlikely that the same Supreme Court that blocked the census citizenship question will now let the Trump administration fabricate data to promote unconstitutional apportionment. Indeed, this entire operation reeks of the kind of “arbitrary” and “capricious” executive action that federal law forbids. Despite these strong odds that Trump’s plan will fail, it does tee up an inevitable, monumental legal battle just around the corner. For decades, states have drawn districts on the basis of overall population. But now, as they prepare for another round of redistricting in 2021, red states like Texas are considering how they can shift power away from cities and communities of color. Once House seats are apportioned, states get to draw the lines for their congressional districts. They also draw districts for their own legislatures. And some state lawmakers are eager to draw these districts by counting citizens, not people. This method would transfer power from diverse urban regions toward white, rural areas—bolstering Republican power in Congress and state legislatures. The Supreme Court has declined to say whether redistricting on the basis of citizen population is unconstitutional, though it very obviously is. Trump, then, is essentially firing the first shot of this impending battle. He has thrown the weight of the executive branch behind the basic proposition that only citizens deserve political representation. And he has sent a message to his political allies in the states to pursue their own efforts to strip immigrants, and the communities that welcome them, of political power. Even if Trump loses this fight over apportionment, the war over who counts in America is really just beginning.", "output": "left"}

Mike Parson doesn’t understand what the big deal is about sending children back to school in the fall. “These kids have got to get back to school,” Parson told a conservative talk radio host. “They’re at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get Covid-19, which they will – and they will when they go to school – they’re not going to the hospitals. They’re not going to have to sit in doctor’s offices. They’re going to go home and they’re going to get over it.” Well that seems simple! Except that it overlooks several important things we know about the coronavirus. Let’s start here: Parson is right that young people (18 and younger) tend to not have severe symptoms if they happen to get the coronavirus. Many are asymptomatic. The problem is, that’s not the point. Schools weren’t closed early in most states this spring to protect the kids. They were closed to protect the teachers, the administrators and all of the other adults – especially the elderly – that kids came into contact with. Because we know that Covid-19 is highly transmissible – and that the older you are, the more danger the virus poses to you. And we also have known for a while now that asymptomatic transmission happens. Which means that even if a kid doesn’t show any signs of illness, he or she could have Covid-19 and pass it along to other kids and other adults that they come into contact with. And then those people can pass it on to others. Lots of others. To that point, a new study out of South Korea suggests that while young children (10 and younger) tend to transmit the virus less well than adults, those 10 to 19 years old spread the virus in ways very similar to adults. Of the study, The New York Times wrote: The findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages, several experts cautioned. “‘I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won’t get infected or don’t get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they’re almost like a bubbled population,’ said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.” Missouri has been fully reopened since mid-June (Parsons ordered the state closed in early April). At a press conference last month, Parson was asked whether he believed he bore any responsibility for the rising number of coronavirus cases in the state. “I don’t know that any one person is responsible for that no more than anybody else standing out here in this hallway,” Parson said. “Do I feel guilty because we have car accidents, and people die every day? No, I don’t feel guilty about that. Each person that gets in those situations, things happen like that in life, they do.” The seven-day average in cases in Missouri is up to 854, according to The New York Times. It was 238 cases a month ago. Parson’s push for kids to return to school – he held a press conference earlier this month making clear he believed schools needed to reopen in the fall – gibes with a similar effort by President Donald Trump at the national level. “Young people have to go to school, and there’s problems when you don’t go to school, too,” Trump told Chris Wallace on Sunday. “And there’s going to be a funding problem because we’re not going to fund – when they don’t open their schools. We’re not going to fund them. We’re not going to give them money if they’re not going to school, if they don’t open.” (Federal dollars account for less than 10% of public school funding.) As coronavirus continues to rage in the country, the fight over whether to reopen schools grows even more complicated (and it was already pretty damn complicated). Oversimplifying the situation or ignoring known medical realities doesn’t help anyone on any side of the issue. Take a note, Gov. Parson.", "output": "left"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Russia is hacking virus vaccine trials, US, UK, Canada say Russia is hacking virus vaccine trials, US, UK, Canada say WASHINGTON (AP) — Western governments on Thursday accused hackers believed to be part of Russian intelligence of trying to steal valuable private information about a coronavirus vaccine, calling out the Kremlin in an unusually detailed public warning to scientists and medical companies. The alleged culprit is a familiar foe. Intelligence agencies in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada say the hacking group APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, is attacking academic and pharmaceutical research institutions involved in COVID-19 vaccine development. The same group was implicated in the hacking of Democratic email accounts during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It was unclear whether any useful information was stolen. But British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said, “It is completely unacceptable that the Russian Intelligence Services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic.” He accused Moscow of pursuing “selfish interests with reckless behavior.” Sticking to more general language, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said, “We worked very closely with our allies to ensure that we would take measures to keep that information safe and we continue do so so.” The allegation that hackers linked to a foreign government are attempting to siphon secret research during the pandemic is not entirely new. U.S. officials as recently as Thursday have accused China of similar conduct. But the latest warning was startling for the detail it provided, attributing the targeting by name to a particular hacking group and specifying the software vulnerabilities the hackers have been exploiting. Also, Russian cyberattacks strike a particular nerve in the U.S. given the Kremlin’s sophisticated campaign to influence the 2016 presidential election. And the coordination of the new warning across continents seemed designed to add heft and gravity to the announcement and to prompt the Western targets of the hackers to protect themselves. “I think (the governments) have very specific intelligence that they can provide,” said John Hultquist, senior director of analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence. “The report is full of specific operational information that defenders can use” to protect their networks. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, rejected the accusations, saying, “We don’t have information about who may have hacked pharmaceutical companies and research centers in Britain.” “We may say one thing: Russia has nothing to do with those attempts,” Peskov said, according to the state news agency Tass. The accusations come at a tenuous time for relations between Russia and both the U.S. and U.K. Besides political ill will, especially among Democrats, about the 2016 election interference, the Trump administration is under pressure to confront Russia over intelligence information that Moscow offered bounties to Taliban fighters to attack allied fighters. The Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, said “it’s clear that Russia’s malign cyber operations and other destabilizing activities — from financial and other material support to non-state actors in Afghanistan to poisoning dissidents in democratic countries — have persisted, even when exposed.” He urged President Donald Trump to condemn such activities. The vaccine assessment came two years to the day after Trump met with Putin in Helsinki and appeared to side with Moscow over U.S. intelligence agencies about the election interference. The U.K. did not say whether Putin knew about the more recent research hacking, but British officials believe such intelligence would be highly prized. Relations between Russia and the U.K., meanwhile, have plummeted since former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a Soviet-made nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury in 2018, though they later recovered. Britain blamed Moscow for the attack, which triggered a round of retaliatory diplomatic expulsions between Russia and Western countries. More broadly, Thursday’s announcement speaks to the cybersecurity vulnerability created by the pandemic and the global race for a vaccine. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency warned in May that cybercriminals and other groups were targeting COVID-19 research, noting at the time that the increase in people teleworking because of the pandemic had created potential avenues for hackers to exploit. Profit-motivated criminals have exploited the situation, and so have foreign governments “who also have their own urgent demands for information about the pandemic and about things like vaccine research,” Tonya Ugoretz, a deputy assistant director in the FBI’s cyber division, said at a cybersecurity conference last month. “Some of them are using their cyber capabilities to, for example, attempt to break into the networks of those who are conducting this research as well as into nongovernmental organizations to satisfy their own information needs,” Ugoretz said. The alert did not name the targeted organizations themselves or say how many were affected. But it did say the organizations were in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, and said the goal was to steal information and intellectual property related to vaccine development. Britain’s NCSC said its assessment was shared by the National Security Agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and by the Canadian Communication Security Establishment. A 16-page advisory prepared by Western agencies and made public Thursday accuses Cozy Bear of using custom malicious software to target a number of organizations globally. The malware, called WellMess and WellMail, has not previously been associated with the group, the advisory said. “In recent attacks targeting COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the group conducted basic vulnerability scanning against specific external IP addresses owned by the organizations. The group then deployed public exploits against the vulnerable services identified,” the advisory said. Cozy Bear is one of two hacking groups suspected of separate break-ins of computer networks of the Democratic National Committee before the 2016 U.S. election. Stolen emails were then published by WikiLeaks in what U.S. intelligence authorities say was an effort to aid Trump’s campaign over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. A report on Russian election interference by former special counsel Robert Mueller called out another group, Fancy Bear, in the hack-and-leak operation. Cozy Bear, though, operates “quietly gaining access and gathering intelligence,” said Hultquist of the Mandiant cybersecurity firm. Their goal, he said, is “good old-fashioned espionage.” Separately, Thursday, Britain accused “Russian actors” of trying to interfere in December’s U.K. national election by circulating leaked or stolen documents online. Unlike in the vaccine report, the U.K. did not allege that the Russian government was involved in the political meddling. —- This version corrects in paragraph 17 that DHS cybersecurity warned of dangers in May, not April.

But the final straw appeared to be a Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally last month that drew an unexpectedly low crowd of about 6,200 people after Parscale had bragged that more than a million people had requested tickets. The president was furious. The shakeup injected familiar turmoil to Trump’s 2020 campaign, which had so far largely avoided the regular staff churn that dominated the president’s 2016 campaign and his White House. It comes as Trump has been struggling in his reelection campaign against presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, with the nation facing health and economic crises during a pandemic that has killed more than 135,000 Americans. The staff change was not expected to alter the day-to-day running of the campaign. News of the shuffle was delivered to Parscale on Wednesday afternoon by White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. Parscale, a political novice, ran Trump’s digital advertising in 2016 and was credited with helping bring about his surprise victory that year. Stepien has been in politics for years, working for former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and serving as Trump’s national field director in 2016. Parscale had been increasingly sidelined in the weeks since the Tulsa rally and as the president’s public and private poll numbers have taken a hit amid the pandemic. Speculation had been rampant about who might be promoted to lead the operation, with names like former Trump strategist Steve Bannon floated. Parscale is a close ally of Kushner, who wields ultimate control over the campaign. A Florida resident, he had not been a regular presence of late in the campaign’s Arlington, Virginia, headquarters, sparking some resentments among staffers. Rather than parting ways completely, Parscale was retained in part because of the difficulty the campaign would have faced in rebuilding its digital advertising operation so close to the Nov. 3 general election. While the Republican National Committee owned most of the campaign’s data, voter modeling and outreach tools, Parscale ran most of the microtargeted online advertising that Trump aides believed were key in 2016. Parscale’s digital advertising firm was among the campaign’s most significant vendors, and some in Trump’s orbit have alleged that the former campaign manager was profiting off the president’s reelection. Parscale has repeatedly denied the claims. Trump has been pressed by allies in recent months to expand his political circle and more forcefully define his run against Biden. Last month, Trump announced a promotion for Stepien and returned former communications chief Jason Miller to his campaign, taking away some of Parscale’s clout and influence. Biden also shuffled his campaign team, albeit much earlier in the cycle, amid a disastrous stretch in his primary run. For Biden, the moves marked genuine shakeups that expanded and changed how his campaign operated. Biden elevated Anita Dunn, effectively displacing his first campaign manager, Greg Schultz, after a fourth-place Iowa finish and as he was already headed for a second embarrassing finish in New Hampshire. Dunn had joined Biden at the outset of his campaign after having served President Barack Obama as a top communications adviser. With Dunn’s urging, Biden hired his current campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, in March after Dunn and others helped resurrect Biden in Nevada and South Carolina and put him on the path to the nomination. Schultz is now at the Democratic National Committee, helping lead the joint battleground strategy among the national party, the Biden campaign and state parties. ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow in Atlanta contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

The consumer price index, which measures what Americans pay for everything from clothing to appliances, rose 0.6% last month on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. In May, prices declined 0.1%. The consumer price index is a closely watched indicator during recessions. The National Bureau of Economic Research said last month that the United States entered a recession in February. Price increases are an encouraging sign of consumer spending — but Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, warned in a note after Tuesday’s numbers that “inflation is unlikely to reappear on the radar screens of Federal Reserve officials for years.” He predicts that “consumer inflation will remain low for the foreseeable future, except for a few Covid-19 price shocks from items in high demand like food at home.” The gasoline index soared 12.3% in June, while food prices rose 0.6%. Because food and energy categories are volatile, the government reports a separate index for core prices. That metric showed a 0.2% uptick in June, the first monthly increase since February. Core prices were down 0.1% in May. Meat costs continue to rise Prices for food at home increased 0.7% from May to June, with much of the jump driven by meat prices. Overall, beef and veal prices rose 4.8%. From April to May, that price increase was an even more dramatic 11%. Temporary closures of meat processing plants have been driving meat prices up. Pork prices grew 3.3%, and bacon got 8.1% more expensive. Hot dog prices grew 4.9%. But fish, eggs and dairy have been getting slightly cheaper. Fish and seafood prices fell 0.7%, dairy prices slipped 0.4%, and egg prices fell by 2.7%. Apparel and home supply costs grow Prices for window and floor coverings and other linens grew 2.1%, and bedroom furniture got 1.6% more expensive. Appliance prices gained 1.7%, and outdoor equipment and supply costs grew 1.3%. Apparel costs also increased. Overall, clothing was 1.7% more expensive in June. The cost of infant and toddler apparel grew 6.5%. Men’s suits prices went up by 4.7%. The increase could be welcome news for retailers that are struggling as office wear becomes irrelevant. For women’s and girls’ clothing, the price increase was a more modest at 0.9%.", "output": "left"}

ViacomCBS will have further announcements on our efforts to combat hate of all kinds.” Page Six reported that Cannon promoted fringe anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about Jewish people, including “the Rothschilds, centralized banking, the 13 families, the bloodlines that control everything even outside of America.” ViacomCBS’s statement did not directly mention anti-white remarks that Cannon made during the same podcast episode where he suggested that white people were inferior to black people because of the color of their skin. “When you have a person that has the lack of pigment, the lack of melanin, that they know that they will be annihilated,” Cannon said. “So, therefore, however they got the power, they have the lack of compassion. Melanin comes with compassion, melanin comes with soul. We call it soul. Soul brothers and sisters. That’s the melanin that connects us. So the people that don’t have it, and I’m going to say this carefully, are a little less.” “When they didn’t have the power of the sun, the sun then started to deteriorate them, so then they’re acting out of fear, they’re acting out of low self-esteem, they’re acting out of a deficiency,” Cannon continued. “So, therefore, the only way that they can act is evil. They have to rob, steal, rape, kill … in order to survive.” “They had to be savages, they had to be barbaric, because they’re in these Nordic mountains, they’re in these rough … environments, so they’re acting as animals,” Cannon added. “So they’re the ones that are actually closer to animals; they’re the ones that are actually the true savages.” WATCH: Nick Cannon says white people are \"a little less,\" \"closer to animals,\" \"the true savages,\" \"acting out of a deficiency so the only way they can act is evil.\" When does he get canceled? pic.twitter.com/vK3TBDW9i8 — Adam Ford (@Adam4d) July 14, 2020", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The law and order president has decided that a convicted criminal should not go to prison. It may be mere coincidence that Roger Stone is an old friend and fellow resident of Florida with a shared crush on Richard Nixon. It may also be mere coincidence that Donald Trump made the announcement on a Friday night, a graveyard shift that has become his favorite for firing inspectors general and others who get in his way. Stone was convicted by a jury last November of obstructing a congressional investigation, lying under oath to Congress and tampering with a witness. He did so to protect Trump. The 67-year-old was scheduled to report by Tuesday to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, to begin serving a sentence of three years and four months. Three and a half years into his presidency, Trump’s intervention was spectacularly unsurprising. He did not grant Stone a full pardon that would have erased his criminal record, which might perhaps have been too incendiary in an election year. Even so, it was one of Trump’s most savage attacks yet on the rule of law. “Trump commutes the prison sentence of Roger Stone while the officers that killed Breonna Taylor are still free,” tweeted Senator Kamala Harris of California, referring to an African American medical worker killed in Louisville, Kentucky, earlier this year. “The two systems of justice in this country must end.” Jeffrey Toobin, the chief legal analyst for CNN, added on the network: “This is the most corrupt and cronyistic act in perhaps all of recent history. Nixon at the height of Watergate never pardoned or commuted the sentences of any of the people involved in Watergate. He thought he could never get away with it.” Personal and political forces worked in favour of Stone, whose cause was reportedly championed by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The self-proclaimed “dirty trickster” and dapper dresser, who has Nixon’s face tattooed on his back, has been pals with Trump since the 1980s, his longest-serving political adviser. Both men are mavericks who relish riling liberals. Stone was involved in the 2016 election campaign and refused to flip in court. According to Howard Fineman, an NBC News analyst, Stone said of Trump earlier on Friday: “He knows I was under enormous pressure to turn on him. It would have eased my situation considerably. But I didn’t.” The implication being that Stone could have revealed damaging information about the president if he chose. Sparing Stone also fits Trump’s “Obamagate” narrative that the special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which documented Russian interference in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy, was a hoax. Stone was convicted for lying to the House intelligence committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. He was one of several Trump associates charged with crimes in the investigation. In a statement on Friday, the White House said Stone was a “victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency”. It added: “There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign, or the Trump Administration, with Russia. Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election.” Mueller’s investigation did find a total of 272 contacts between Trump’s campaign team and Russia-linked operatives, including at least 38 meetings. More broadly, Trump, often frustrated by Congress or the constitution, has embraced the pardon power like a medieval monarch. Among the beneficiaries have been the conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza, the ex-Arizona-county-sheriff Joe Arpaio, the former White House aide Lewis “Scooter” Libby, the former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik, the financier Michael Milken and the newspaper publisher Conrad Black, who had written a laudatory book about the president. Trump even commuted the prison sentence of the Democratic former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who had been a contestant on Trump’s TV show Celebrity Apprentice. Meanwhile the US attorney general, William Barr, is seeking to dismiss charges against Trump’s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI but is seen by Trump as another Mueller martyr. Even as he demands arrest and jail for protesters who topple statues, the president is straining the justice system to breaking point with his selective application of executive clemency. But what if he starts prosecuting perceived enemies, too? Don’t expect Barr to stand in his way.", "output": "left"}

The loan money, intended to provide relief to small businesses that were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic, was approved for Media Matters by Bank of America on April 29, after the progressive outlet criticized the Trump administration for its handling of the rescue funds, suggesting the administration would not seek “enough to do the job.” Politically-affiliated nonprofits benefiting from the small business loans, which were created as part of the CARES Act and lent $521 billion through June 30, came to light in April, as Breitbart News reported, after several groups such as state affiliates of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center filed applications for the loans. Treasury data has so far revealed that branches of the ACLU in Texas, Montana, and North Carolina borrowed between $150,000 and $350,000. “The PPP is providing much-needed relief to millions of American small businesses, supporting more than 51 million jobs and over 80 percent of all small business employees, who are the drivers of economic growth in our country,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Critics have pointed to a conflict of interest for groups with political motivations — such as the progressive Media Matters, which has received funding from prominent liberal donors like Soros — pocketing the taxpayer-funded relief money. Media Matters founder David Brock also founded the super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, for example, which funded in key swing states advertisements attacking President Donald Trump’s “incompetency” in his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Jovita Carranza emphasized the benefits of the paycheck relief program, saying, “In three months, this Administration was able to act quickly to get funding into the hands of those who faced enormous obstacles as a result of the pandemic.” Although a variety of hard-hit industries from health care to hospitality were able to benefit from the funding, Media Matters received a higher-than-average loan, with the average being $100,000, according to Mnuchin. The loans provided through the PPP will be forgiven so long as the money is directed toward payroll — with the stipulation that employees are retained or quickly rehired, and salary levels are maintained — and interest on mortgages, rent, and utilities, according to the SBA.", "output": "right"}

Rushmore and in Washington, D.C. that attempted to rally conservative support by demonizing the left and defending monuments. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values, and indoctrinate our children,” Trump said on Friday night at Mt. Rushmore, as he tried to revive his base following an embarrassing turnout in Tulsa. “Angry mobs are trying to tear down statues of our founders, deface our most sacred memorials, and unleash a wave of violent crime in our cities.” Trump, who last weekend promoted a video advocating “white power,” has defended honoring the racist Confederacy with statues and at military bases. While Trump has a history of racism, the Washington Post notes that his strategy of “amplifying racism and stoking culture wars” has been especially striking in this particular moment of national reckoning, one that Trump has responded to with stunningly divisive rhetoric “seeking to weaponize the anger and resentment of some white Americans for his own political gain” rather than calming a country in crisis. Trump has responded to the outcry for reform with a reimagined version of the “American carnage” he cited at his inauguration, during which he painted a dark picture of a United States exploited by immigrants and foreign nations. But unlike in 2016, notes the Post’s David Nakamura, the enemy has also become other Americans who, in challenging the nation’s founding ideals, pose a threat to Trump’s conservative base. “We are now in the process of defeating the radical left—the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters,” the president remarked on Saturday. On Friday, he warned of “the violent mayhem we have seen in the streets of cities that are run by liberal Democrats,” drawing battle lines in an attempt to galvanize supporters. “Our children are taught in school to hate their own country,” he claimed. From the Black Hills of South Dakota, Trump warned of a “new far-left fascism” and “cancel culture” that “is designed to overthrow the American Revolution.” Trump continued to put forth such messaging from the White House on Saturday, during which he vowed to “never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms.” The president pledged to “defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.” On Friday, Trump described the goal of protesters to be “the end of America.” “That’s not just bigotry to the outside world, but now he’s really attacking millions of Americans as worthless, as socialists, as anarchists,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley of the “deeply divisive speech.” The New York Times reported both speeches to be “a reflection of his dire political standing” as he strives to win reelection without “a booming economy or a positive message to campaign on,” a moment that has him instead making appeals to racists and sowing division. In Washington, the president praised his administration’s handling of the pandemic and again suggested increased cases to merely be the result of more testing, a false claim he repeated to Saturday’s crowd. “The aperture of the campaign is constricting, not expanding—he’s energizing a smaller and smaller group of angrier and angrier Americans,” Peter Wehner, a former speechwriter for president George W. Bush, told the Post. “And to try to energize that base, he has to say more and more extreme things.” — The Parallel Universe of Ivanka Trump, America’s Dissociated Princess — “No, I Am Not Okay”: A Black Journalist Addresses His White Friends — Why Bankrupt Hertz Is a Pandemic Zombie — Scenes of Fury and Mourning at the Minneapolis Protests — Civil Rights Advocate Brandi Collins-Dexter on Why Facebook Chooses Trump Over Democracy — Democrats’ Blue-Texas Fever Dream May Finally Become a Reality — From the Archive: Taking Stock of Melania Trump, the Unprepared—And Lonely—FLOTUS Looking for more?

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The New York Times ran a story this week suggesting that the economic recovery is slowing and, in certain industries in certain parts of the country, even reversing. This makes sense given the resurgence of coronavirus cases in places like Texas and Florida and the more-cautious reopening measures being taken in other, less affected areas worried that a spike might be just around the corner. On Wednesday, New York City announced it would indefinitely postpone the resumption of indoor dining service, as New Jersey did a few days prior. California has also ordered restaurants and bars to close again in much of the state. It’s likely that in the coming weeks, we’ll see that spending in food and beverage service establishments has gone back into decline nationally. There are two separate trends we may be seeing right now that are causing the economic recovery to slow, and they may be difficult to differentiate when looking at the data. One is the growing realization that it will be more difficult for certain sectors of the economy to return before the virus is fully tamed than previously thought. Some businesses were in a position to reopen quickly when allowed to do so; many of them have already reopened and part, or all of, their staff has returned to work. But other businesses will be disrupted persistently until there is an effective medical treatment for COVID-19, and some businesses will never reopen at all; it will necessarily take more time for workers and owners in those businesses to find new things to do. This has always been a reason not to get too complacent about the pace of the recovery and to ensure that the economy has adequate government policy support after the expiration of key CARES Act programs this summer. One thing we may have been learning in the past couple of weeks is that more of the hospitality industry will be in the persistently affected category than we had hoped, waiting for effective medical interventions before the industry can return anywhere close to normal, and with some establishments closing permanently in the meantime. The other factor slowing the recovery is, of course, a worsening of epidemiological conditions in large swaths of the country. You can see the regional effects in data from OpenTable, which has been providing daily information on the number of diners seated in its member establishments since the start of the epidemic. Nationally, restaurants on the OpenTable network were about twice as busy at the end of June as they were at the beginning, with customer volumes down about 60 percent from the prior year instead of 80 percent. But there is significant regional variation: Restaurant traffic started falling in mid-June in Phoenix and in late June in major Texas metropolitan areas, even as it continued to rise (from a very low base) in northeastern markets. Importantly, customer volumes in Texas started falling before the state announced it would close bars and reduce restaurant capacity. In New York City, where only outdoor dining is permitted, OpenTable is recording just 6 percent of usual volumes — but that’s an increase from 0 percent at the start of the month, when restaurants were closed altogether. Debates about when to impose and lift activity restrictions aimed at stopping the coronavirus are often framed as pitting economic growth against disease prevention, but this frame is wrong for two reasons. First, as the economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Svyerson argue in a new working paper comparing economic activity in adjacent counties with differing coronavirus-related regulations, coronavirus-related drops in economic activity appear to be overwhelmingly driven by choices made by individual consumers and firms, not by government regulation. Regulations are important for determining the precise nature of economic activity — when you close indoor dining, people spend less in restaurants and more in grocery stores — but have relatively modest effects on the aggregate amount of economic activity. That is, if people are scared of getting sick, they will go out and work less and spend less, even if the government does not order certain kinds of businesses to close. Second, when you permit activities that are especially risky from a virus- transmission perspective, all other activities become riskier than they would otherwise be as a result. If you open bars and people take that opportunity to hold coronavirus super-spreading events with groups of friends, there is a larger population of infected people out there who can give COVID-19 to people they meet at the office, or in a supermarket, or in a small gathering at a neighbor’s home. So while reopening bars would seem to be a way to let some people go back to work, generate some more sales tax revenue, and give a frustrated public another opportunity to blow off steam, it is likely that jurisdictions that reopened their bars hurt their economies by increasing the virus spread and making members of the public reasonably more afraid to engage in a wide variety of activities seemingly unrelated to bars. The fact that better epidemiological conditions allow you to engage in more economic activity makes it especially crazy that so many conservatives who favor a faster economic reopening have been critical of mask mandates and dismissive of private choices to wear them — even sometimes saying, as Republican consultant Alex Castellanos did this week, that masks are a social and political affectation. There are some questions about whether masks are truly necessary in some settings. But widespread mask-wearing in public indoor spaces should make congregating indoors for economic purposes less hazardous and therefore make a wider variety of economic activities sustainable. So while aspects of the recovery are at significant risk today, there is a road map toward a faster and more stable recovery: Wear masks, especially indoors, and don’t let people conduct especially hazardous indoor activities. It should have been possible to infer these lessons from events in Europe and New York in March and April, but it is good news that officials in the South and Southwest appear to be learning them now, however belatedly. Closing the bars should put us on a better track toward keeping other parts of the economy open, especially if people keep their faces covered.", "output": "left"}

June’s job gains were a record and easily beat forecasters’ expectations. Nevertheless, the jobs report is clouded by the fact that, even with the improvements, the labor market was in historically bad shape even before coronavirus outbreaks worsened throughout the South and West later in June. “Looking beyond the June employment data, worrisome signs have emerged in recent days regarding a pullback in store traffic and spending likely linked to the resurgence of COVID-19,” said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “While the economy is widely thought to be rebounding now that we’ve quietly slipped into the third quarter, the strength and sustainability of the rebound remain at risk.” Perhaps most troubling, Thursday’s report showed a higher number, 2.8 million, of job losses described as permanent. In previous months of the pandemic, around 90% of job losses had been described as temporary, suggesting that the workers hoped to go back to their old jobs once the pandemic passed. Two-fifths of June’s job gains took place in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had been badly bruised by the pandemic. Those jobs, though, are the ones most in danger from rising cases of the coronavirus. Restaurants and bars in several states have had to curtail service in the past few weeks. Employment in retail rose by 740,000 last month, after a gain of 372,000 in May and losses totaling 2.4 million in March and April combined. On net, employment in this sector is 1.3 million lower than in February. While the unemployment rate has dropped for two consecutive months, the improvement is uneven among the races. The jobless rate in June for white workers was 10.1%, while the unemployment rates for Black or African American, Asian, and Hispanic or Latino workers were much higher: 15.4%, 13.8% and 14.5%, respectively. The unemployment rate for teenagers between 16 and 19 years old was 23.2% in June. During the same month last years, the jobless rate was 15% for the category. ADP on Wednesday reported that nearly 2.4 million private sector jobs were added in June. The data processing company also made a huge revision of 6 million in its estimate of private sector employment for May. June’s jobs numbers come as Arizona recorded nearly 4,878 new cases and 88 new deaths Wednesday, a record single-day jump for the state. Texas health officials reported 57 new deaths Wednesday, the most since May 14, when the state set a record with 58 daily deaths. And in California, 107 deaths due to COVID-19 were reported Tuesday, the first time the daily death toll has surpassed 100 since June 10. The data for Friday’s report, though, was collected before the massive increase in infections in the second half of June. Subsequently, many businesses in the South and West shut down to avoid spreading the virus, and many restaurants and bars had greater restrictions imposed on them by state and local governments. Those closings are likely to raise unemployment next month. Thursday’s Labor Department report follows the shocking news from last month that showed the economy gained 2.5 million jobs in May and lowered the unemployment rate to 13.3%. Forecasters had expected job losses of 8 million and an unemployment rate of about 20%. In the face of soaring unemployment, Democrats, such as Rep. Jim Clyburn from South Carolina, are calling on the GOP-led Senate to extend the $600 unemployment bonus payment beyond its July 31 expiration date. “Now is not the time to pull the rug out from our fragile economy,” Clyburn said on Wednesday. “Federal support like the $600 unemployment insurance benefit are propping up the economy and keeping millions of people out of poverty.” The March CARES Act provided extra $600 weekly payments in addition to regular unemployment insurance. It is a flat payment that does not take into account former salary levels or whether the worker was part time or full time. The House in May approved legislation that extended these payments to January 31, 2021. The Democratic legislation would also give $1 trillion in funding to states and cities to avoid layoffs. Thursday’s report showed a loss of 25,000 state government jobs. The Senate is not expected to take up the bill, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, has vowed to not extend the measure. A large majority of recipients would earn more from benefits than from work if the $600-a-week pandemic unemployment benefit boost is extended past its July expiration, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.", "output": "right"}

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced Monday that the planned end of the ban on indoor restaurant dining, initially set for Thursday, is canceled. He cited surges in several other states, “driven by, in part, the return of indoor dining.” “We’ve always said that we would not hesitate to hit pause if needed to safeguard public health,” Murphy tweeted. “This is one of those times.” UPDATE: INDOOR DINING WILL NO LONGER RESUME ON THURSDAY. We had planned to loosen restrictions this week. However, after #COVID19 spikes in other states driven by, in part, the return of indoor dining, we have decided to postpone indoor dining indefinitely. — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) June 29, 2020 New Jersey reported as many as 3,000 new coronavirus cases each day in April, but the number of new cases has been on the decline through May and June. Murphy said Monday that 156 new cases had been reported, bringing the state’s cumulative total to 171,272. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also said Monday that he is reconsidering whether to allow New York City to resume indoor dining, which is currently scheduled for July 6. Outdoor dining in New York City was permitted to resume June 22. Cuomo described indoor dining as a “real problem” and said he is concerned about a lack of social distancing and mask-wearing in the city as well as in states that reopening much earlier than New York. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also cited worries about allowing restaurants to resume indoor dining as part of the city’s phase three reopening plans. He said in his press briefing that he spoke with Cuomo’s office over the weekend and would update the public on the city’s plans in the coming days. “We’re at a watershed moment for the city of New York. We have to get it right. We’re going to make adjustments all the time, and we’ll be open to you about when we need to make adjustments,” de Blasio said Monday. “But we’re also going to be very open about the progress and what we need to do. When we see a problem, like concerns about indoor dining, we have to address it,” he added. Arizona reported over 600 new cases and no new deaths Monday, but the number of cases is likely much higher than reported as the health department has not been able to update totals. Arizona’s seven-day rolling average for new cases is 12% higher than it was a week ago, according to data collected by the Washington Post. Gov. Doug Ducey ordered bars, gyms, and theaters to shut down Monday night, saying that he hoped to have them reopened within 30 days. “With this targeted approach, we know that we can pump the brakes,” he said in an afternoon press conference. Florida reported 5,276 new coronavirus cases and 28 deaths Monday, bringing the total number of cases and deaths in the state during the coronavirus pandemic to over 156,792 and 3,546, respectively. Although the new daily case number was lower than the day before, as a rolling seven-day average, it was a record high at 6,589, according to Washington Post data. The Department of Health and Human Services has secured more than 500,000 doses of remdesivir, the first drug shown to be effective in treating coronavirus patients in clinical trials. HHS will be in charge of allocating doses of the drug through September. Pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences plans to introduce remdesivir to the market as early as July. Gilead announced pricing plans Monday, which include charging lower rates to the Department of Veterans Affairs but higher rates for private insurance companies. A Gilead spokesperson said Monday that “the vast majority of patients are expected to receive a five-day treatment course using six vials of remdesivir, which equates to $2,340 per patient.” Jacksonville, the largest city in Florida and host of the upcoming Republican National Convention, made mask-wearing mandatory Monday. Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, now has at least 5,830 confirmed COVID-19 infections and at least 64 deaths. Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Monday that the surging number of coronavirus cases could result in nearly half the country infected by the end of the year, “and that’s if we just stay at our current rate.” “To have the level of infection that they’re diagnosing now [in southern states] and the hospitalizations that they’re starting to see, the community spread is pretty pervasive,” Gottlieb told CNBC. Gottlieb added that the cohort primarily affected by the latest surge in cases, younger people, will change, and the virus will soon infect more elderly people, driving up the death toll. “We’re not seeing the number of deaths that we saw during the first wave of infection … but that won’t stay that way,” he said. “Eventually, it will start to seep into older people, more vulnerable people, and you’ll start to see the total number of deaths go up … the total number of deaths will go back up, and we’ll probably get above 1,000 deaths a day on average.”", "output": "right"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "It was late Friday when the New York Times first reported on a stunning story: according to U.S. intelligence, while peace talks were underway to end the long-running conflict in Afghanistan, a Russian military intelligence unit \"offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants for killing coalition forces in Afghanistan -- including targeting American troops.\" Soon after, most of the nation's leading news agencies confirmed the story: U.S. intelligence agencies have reason to believe Vladimir Putin's government offered financial rewards to those who killed American servicemen and women. Among the many questions is when, exactly, Donald Trump learned of the allegations. The initial reporting indicated that the information reached the Oval Office three months ago. In an overnight report, the NYT updated the timeline: despite White House efforts to say the American president was clueless, administration officials indicated that Trump was presented with the information in writing in February. [Two officials told the Times] that the intelligence was included months ago in Mr. Trump's President's Daily Brief document -- a compilation of the government's latest secrets and best insights about foreign policy and national security that is prepared for him to read. One of the officials said the item appeared in Mr. Trump's brief in late February; the other cited Feb. 27, specifically. Moreover, a description of the intelligence assessment that the Russian unit had carried out the bounties plot was also seen as serious and solid enough to disseminate more broadly across the intelligence community in a May 4 article in the C.I.A.'s World Intelligence Review, a classified compendium commonly referred to as The Wire, two officials said. It's not exactly a secret that Trump does not read the President's Daily Brief. What's more, the Associated Press reported that the revelations reached the West Wing even earlier. Top officials in the White House were aware in early 2019 of classified intelligence indicating Russia was secretly offering bounties to the Taliban for the deaths of Americans, a full year earlier than has been previously reported, according to U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the intelligence. The assessment was included in at least one of President Donald Trump's written daily intelligence briefings at the time, according to the officials. Then-national security adviser John Bolton also told colleagues he briefed Trump on the intelligence assessment in March 2019. This is not the sort of controversy that quietly fades away. U.S. intelligence agencies came to believe that Moscow was paying for the murder of American troops; that information was brought directly to the Oval Office; and confronted with the information, Trump apparently did nothing. Well, perhaps \"nothing\" is misleading: Trump actually started doing favors for the Kremlin, including endorsing Russia's re-entry into the G-7 and vowing to remove U.S. troops from Germany. From the White House's perspective, the best-case scenario is that the American president was presented with this explosive intelligence and simply failed to read any of the relevant information, sticking his head in the sand as his own country's troops came under fire. The worst-case scenario is that Trump learned of the allegations, remained chummy with Putin, and started advancing Moscow's agenda anyway. Making matters just a bit worse, the White House's explanation for what the president knew is, at least for now, largely incoherent. On Sunday night, Trump published a tweet suggesting he'd received an intelligence briefing on the controversy. On Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted the president had not, in fact, received any briefing on the matter. What's more, while Trump said the allegations were deemed not credible by U.S. intelligence, McEnany told reporters that the information was still being \"evaluated.\" It's generally a bad sign when a president and his own White House struggle to get their stories straight. For that matter, the latest reporting suggesting that the allegations were included in the President's Daily Brief (PDB) obviously contradict the press secretary's argument yesterday that Trump \"was not briefed on this.\" If that weren't strange enough, McEnany went on to say the president, as of yesterday afternoon, still hadn't been briefed on this -- despite Trump's tweet to the contrary, and despite the fact that some members of Congress were receiving an intelligence briefing on the matter at roughly that time. British officials were also reportedly informed about the allegations last week. Or put another way, the Trump administration learned of important intelligence, shared it with allies, presented it to members of Congress, circulated it among intelligence agencies, but according to the White House, the president was kept in the dark -- despite multiple reports that Trump was handed the information as far back as last year. If the West Wing thinks this is going to work as a compelling explanation, it's mistaken.", "output": "left"}

DeSantis announced that the state has no plans to curtail restart dates that they have already approved. \"We are monitoring all aspects related to COVID-19 in Florida and do not have plans to roll back any approved reopening business plans at this time,\" the governor's office sent in a statement to WSTP. DISNEY WORLD CANCELS HALLOWEEN PARTY, ADJUSTS EPCOT FESTIVAL DATE BEFORE REOPENING This includes central Florida’s biggest employer: Disney World. The Florida theme park, whose reopening plans were approved back in May, is still set to open as early as July 11 despite pleas from cast members urging government officials and park executives to delay their plans out of the safety of guests and staff members. Many of their concerns were detailed in a petition on moveon.org, which has since notched over 12,000 signatures as of Friday morning. DISNEYLAND RELEASES UPDATED HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES AS IT NEARS REOPENING DATE \"Because of the increase in cases suddenly, it is clear that theme parks – a non-essential business – should not be planning to operate until the cases have gone down again,\" the petition stated. \"While theme parks are a great way to relax and enjoy free time, it is a non-essential business; it is not fair to the people who work there to risk their lives, especially if they are at risk or have family members who are at risk. People are more important than making a profit.\" Disney's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom parks are slated to open on July 11 followed by EPCOT and Hollywood Studios on July 15. The phased reopening will effectively end a nearly four-month shut down that stifled business for the employer who has a workforce of 77,000 employees. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS However, the petition suggests that Disney should halt its reopening plans until cases have gone down again and that \"retreating back to an earlier Phase in re-opening\" is the best way to prevent exposing the thousands of theme park employees and their families to the virus. Representatives for Walt Disney World and Gov. DeSantis have not immediately returned Fox News' request for comment. This past week, Florida’s caseload surpassed the 100,000-person mark. On Tuesday, the Sunshine State had 103,503 cases, a daily jump of 3,286 cases. Florida also reported 3,238 deaths, an increase of 64 from the previous day. The newly announced cases ranged from the top federal prosecutor in Tallahassee to 11 athletes on different teams at the University of Florida. By contrast, Disney announced it was postponing the mid-July reopening of its Southern California theme parks until it receives guidelines from the state. Disney also will delay the planned July 23 reopening of its Grand Californian and Paradise Pier hotels. The quick reversal came after Gov. Gavin Newsom voiced concerns about reopening amid the recent increases in COVID-19 infections across Southern California counties.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "From the Magazine: ‘It Is Time for Reparations’ Nikole Hannah-Jones explains the history of economic injustice and argues that if black lives are to truly matter in America, the nation must finally pay its debts. From the Magazine: ‘It Is Time for Reparations’ If true justice and equality are ever to be achieved in the United States, the country must finally take seriously what it owes black Americans. It feels different this time. Black Americans protesting the violation of their rights are a defining tradition of this country. In the last century, there have been hundreds of uprisings in black communities in response to white violence. Some have produced substantive change. After the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, uprisings in more than 100 cities broke the final congressional deadlock over whether it should be illegal to deny people housing simply because they descended from people who had been enslaved. The Fair Housing Act, which prohibits housing discrimination on the basis of race, gender and religion, among other categories, seemed destined to die in Congress as white Southerners were joined by many of their Northern counterparts who knew housing segregation was central to how Jim Crow was accomplished in the North. But just seven days after King’s death, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the act into law from the smoldering capital, which was still under protection from the National Guard. Most of the time these uprisings have produced hand-wringing and consternation but few necessary structural changes. After black uprisings swept the nation in the mid-1960s, Johnson created the Kerner Commission to examine their causes, and the report it issued in 1968 recommended a national effort to dismantle segregation and structural racism across American institutions. It was shelved by the president, like so many similar reports, and instead white Americans voted in a “law and order” president, Richard Nixon. The following decades brought increased police militarization, law-enforcement spending and mass incarceration of black Americans. The changes we’re seeing today in some ways seem shockingly swift, and in other ways rage-inducingly slow. After years of black-led activism, protest and organizing, the weeks of protests since George Floyd’s killing have moved lawmakers to ban chokeholds by police officers, consider stripping law enforcement of the qualified immunity that has made it almost impossible to hold responsible officers who kill, and discuss moving significant parts of ballooning police budgets into funding for social services. Black Lives Matter, the group founded in 2013 by three black women, Patrisse Khan-Cullors, Alicia Garza and Opal Tometi, after the acquittal of Trayvon Martin’s killer, saw its support among American voters rise almost as much in the two weeks after Floyd’s killing than in the last two years. According to polling by Civiqs, more than 50 percent of registered voters now say they support the movement. The cascading effect of these protests has been something to behold. The commissioner of the N.F.L., which blackballed Colin Kaepernick for daring to respectfully protest police brutality, announced that the N.F.L. had, in fact, been wrong and that black lives actually do matter. (Kaepernick, on the other hand, still has no job.) HBO Max announced that it would temporarily pull from its roster the Lost Cause propaganda film “Gone With the Wind” — which in classically American fashion holds the spot as the highest-grossing feature film of all time. NASCAR came to the sudden realization that its decades-long permissiveness toward fans’ waving the battle flag of a traitorous would-be nation that fought to preserve the right to traffic black people was, in fact, contrary to its “commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry.” Bubba Wallace, the only full-time black driver at the sport’s top level, who had called on NASCAR to make the move, drove victory laps in an all-black stock car emblazoned with the words “#BLACKLIVESMATTER.” Multiracial groups of Americans have defaced or snatched down monuments to enslavers and bigots from Virginia to Philadelphia to Minneapolis and New Mexico, leading local and state politicians to locate the moral courage to realize that they indeed did have the power to purge from public spaces icons to white supremacy. Even the University of Alabama, the place where Gov. George Wallace quite literally stood in the schoolhouse door to try to block the court-ordered admission of two black students, a place whose Grecian-columned campus and still largely segregated sororities pose the living embodiment of Dixie, is removing three plaques honoring Confederate soldiers and will study whether to rename buildings holding the monikers of enslavers and white supremacists after a student-led campaign garnered more than 17,000 signatures. Unlike so many times in the past, in which black people mostly marched and protested alone to demand recognition of their full humanity and citizenship, a multiracial and multigenerational protest army has taken to the streets over the last month. They’ve spread across all 50 states in places big and small, including historically all-white towns like Vidor, Texas, where as recently as 1993 a federal judge had to order its public housing integrated. Shortly after, white supremacists ran out of town the handful of black people who had moved in. That Vidor, Texas, which remains 91 percent white and 0.5 percent black, held a Black Lives Matter rally in early June. In countries as disparate as England, Brazil, Kenya and Turkey, crowds pumped fists and carried signs with George Floyd’s name. And this month, a Monmouth University poll showed that 76 percent of Americans, and 71 percent of white Americans, believe that racial and ethnic discrimination is a “big problem” in the United States. Just a few years ago, little more than half of white Americans believed that. The numbers in the Monmouth poll were so high that it left some political scientists questioning the poll’s quality. “This number is crazy,” Hakeem Jefferson, a Stanford University political scientist, told me. “When I saw it, I thought, ‘This is a polling error.’ So I did what good social scientists do. I opened the methodological report, worried that they had done a weird sampling. But this is high-quality data.” It is hard in the midst of something momentous to pinpoint exactly what has caused it. What we’re seeing is most likely a result of unrelenting organizing by the Black Lives Matter movement. It’s the pandemic, which virtually overnight left staggering numbers of Americans without enough money to buy food, pay rent and sustain their businesses. For many white Americans who may have once, consciously or unconsciously, looked down upon this nation’s heavily black and brown low-wage service workers, Covid-19 made them realize that it was the delivery driver and grocery clerk and meatpacker who made it possible for them to remain safely sequestered in their homes — and these workers were dying for it. Black Americans, in particular, have borne a disproportionate number of deaths from both Covid-19 and law enforcement, and many nonblack protesters have reasoned that black people should not have to risk their lives alone in taking to the streets demanding that the state not execute its citizens without consequence. And as they did, white Americans both in the streets and through the screens of their phones and televisions got a taste of the wanton police violence that black Americans regularly face. They saw the police beating up white women, pushing down an elderly white man and throwing tear gas and shooting rubber bullets at demonstrators exercising their democratic right to peacefully protest. With so many Americans working from home or not working at all, they have had the time to show up to protests every day. These protests not only give Americans who are not black a moral reason to leave their homes after weeks of social isolation; they also allow protesters to vent anger at the incompetence of the man in the White House, himself a product of this nation’s inability to escape its death pact with white supremacy, who they sense is imperiling this terribly flawed but miraculous country. It has been more than 150 years since the white planter class last called up the slave patrols and deputized every white citizen to stop, question and subdue any black person who came across their paths in order to control and surveil a population who refused to submit to their enslavement. It has been 150 years since white Americans could enforce slave laws that said white people acting in the interest of the planter class would not be punished for killing a black person, even for the most minor alleged offense. Those laws morphed into the black codes, passed by white Southern politicians at the end of the Civil War to criminalize behaviors like not having a job. Those black codes were struck down, then altered and over the course of decades eventually transmuted into stop-and-frisk, broken windows and, of course, qualified immunity. The names of the mechanisms of social control have changed, but the presumption that white patrollers have the legal right to kill black people deemed to have committed minor infractions or to have breached the social order has remained. In a country erected on the explicitly codified conviction that black lives mattered less, graveyards across this land hold the bodies of black Americans, men, women and children, legally killed by the institutional descendants of those slave patrols for alleged transgressions like walking from the store with Skittles, playing with a toy gun in the park, sleeping in their homes and selling untaxed cigarettes. We collectively know only a small number of their names: Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Kendra James, Breonna Taylor, Rekia Boyd, Eric Garner, Aiyana Stanley-Jones and Tanisha Anderson are just a few. And because of what is happening now, George Floyd’s name will forever stand out since enough Americans have decided that his death mattered. What has spawned this extraordinary reckoning, the fire this time, was our collective witness of what must be described without hyperbole as a modern-day lynching. In his 1933 book, “The Tragedy of Lynching,” the sociologist Arthur F. Raper estimated that, based on his study of 100 lynchings, white police officers participated in at least half of all lynchings and that in 90 percent of others law-enforcement officers “either condone or wink at the mob action.” The nonchalant look on Officer Derek Chauvin’s face — as, hand in pocket, for 8 minutes 46 seconds, he pressed his knee against the neck of a facedown black man begging for his life — reminds me of every callous white face captured in the grisly photos taken in the 1900s to mark the gleeful spectacle of the public killings of black men and women. It devastates black people that all the other black deaths before George Floyd did not get us here. It devastates black people to recall all the excuses that have come before. That big black boy, Michael Brown, must have charged the weapon-carrying officer. Eric Garner should have stopped struggling. Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend had a weapon in her home and shouldn’t have shot at the people who, without a knock or an announcement, burst through her door. We’re not sure what Ahmaud Arbery was doing in that predominantly white neighborhood. Rayshard Brooks, who in the midst of nationwide protests against police violence was shot in the back twice by a police officer, just shouldn’t have resisted. It should devastate us all that in 2020 it took a cellphone video broadcast across the globe of a black man dying from the oldest and most terrifying tool in the white-supremacist arsenal to make a vast majority of white Americans decide that, well, this might be enough. We, now, have finally arrived at the point of this essay. Because when it comes to truly explaining racial injustice in this country, the table should never be set quickly: There is too much to know, and yet we aggressively choose not to know it. No one can predict whether this uprising will lead to lasting change. History does not bode well. But there does seem to be a widespread acceptance of the most obvious action we could take toward equality in a nation built on the espoused ideals of inalienable, universal rights: pass reforms and laws that ensure that black people cannot be killed by armed agents of the state without consequence. But on its own, this cannot bring justice to America. If we are truly at the precipice of a transformative moment, the most tragic of outcomes would be that the demand be too timid and the resolution too small. If we are indeed serious about creating a more just society, we must go much further than that. We must get to the root of it. Fifty years since the bloody and brutally repressed protests and freedom struggles of black Americans brought about the end of legal discrimination in this country, so much of what makes black lives hard, what takes black lives earlier, what causes black Americans to be vulnerable to the type of surveillance and policing that killed Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, what steals opportunities, is the lack of wealth that has been a defining feature of black life since the end of slavery. Wealth, not income, is the means to security in America. Wealth — assets and investments minus debt — is what enables you to buy homes in safer neighborhoods with better amenities and better-funded schools. It is what enables you to send your children to college without saddling them with tens of thousands of dollars of debt and what provides you money to put a down payment on a house. It is what prevents family emergencies or unexpected job losses from turning into catastrophes that leave you homeless and destitute. It is what ensures what every parent wants — that your children will have fewer struggles than you did. Wealth is security and peace of mind. It’s not incidental that wealthier people are healthier and live longer. Wealth is, as a recent Yale study states, “the most consequential index of economic well-being” for most Americans. But wealth is not something people create solely by themselves; it is accumulated across generations. While unchecked discrimination still plays a significant role in shunting opportunities for black Americans, it is white Americans’ centuries-long economic head start that most effectively maintains racial caste today. As soon as laws began to ban racial discrimination against black Americans, white Americans created so-called race-neutral means of maintaining political and economic power. For example, soon after the 15th Amendment granted black men the right to vote, white politicians in many states, understanding that recently freed black Americans were impoverished, implemented poll taxes. In other words, white Americans have long known that in a country where black people have been kept disproportionately poor and prevented from building wealth, rules and policies involving money can be nearly as effective for maintaining the color line as legal segregation. You do not have to have laws forcing segregated housing and schools if white Americans, using their generational wealth and higher incomes, can simply buy their way into expensive enclaves with exclusive public schools that are out of the price range of most black Americans. It has worked with impressive efficiency. Today black Americans remain the most segregated group of people in America and are five times as likely to live in high-poverty neighborhoods as white Americans. Not even high earnings inoculate black people against racialized disadvantage. Black families earning $75,000 or more a year live in poorer neighborhoods than white Americans earning less than $40,000 a year, research by John Logan, a Brown University sociologist, shows. According to another study, by the Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon and his colleagues, the average black family earning $100,000 a year lives in a neighborhood with an average annual income of $54,000. Black Americans with high incomes are still black: They face discrimination across American life. But it is because their families have not been able to build wealth that they are often unable to come up with a down payment to buy in more affluent neighborhoods, while white Americans with lower incomes often use familial wealth to do so. The difference between the lived experience of black Americans and white Americans when it comes to wealth — along the entire spectrum of income from the poorest to the richest — can be described as nothing other than a chasm. According to research published this year by scholars at Duke University and Northwestern University that doesn’t even take into account the yet-unknown financial wreckage of Covid-19, the average black family with children holds just one cent of wealth for every dollar that the average white family with children holds. As President Johnson, architect of the Great Society, explained in a 1965 speech titled “To Fulfill These Rights”: “Negro poverty is not white poverty. … These differences are not racial differences. They are solely and simply the consequence of ancient brutality, past injustice and present prejudice. They are anguishing to observe. For the Negro they are a constant reminder of oppression. For the white they are a constant reminder of guilt. But they must be faced, and they must be dealt with, and they must be overcome; if we are ever to reach the time when the only difference between Negroes and whites is the color of their skin.” We sometimes forget, and perhaps it is an intentional forgetting, that the racism we are fighting today was originally conjured to justify working unfree black people, often until death, to generate extravagant riches for European colonial powers, the white planter class and all the ancillary white people from Midwestern farmers to bankers to sailors to textile workers, who earned their living and built their wealth from free black labor and the products that labor produced. The prosperity of this country is inextricably linked with the forced labor of the ancestors of 40 million black Americans for whom these marches are now occurring, just as it is linked to the stolen land of the country’s indigenous people. Though our high school history books seldom make this plain: Slavery and the 100-year period of racial apartheid and racial terrorism known as Jim Crow were, above all else, systems of economic exploitation. To borrow from Ta-Nehisi Coates’s phrasing, racism is the child of economic profiteering, not the father. Numerous legal efforts to strip black people of their humanity existed to justify the extraction of profit. Beginning in the 1660s, white officials ensured that all children born to enslaved women would also be enslaved and belong not to their mothers but to the white men who owned their mothers. They passed laws dictating that the child’s status would follow that of the mother not the father, upending European norms and guaranteeing that the children of enslaved women who were sexually assaulted by white men would be born enslaved and not free. It meant that profit for white people could be made from black women’s wombs. Laws determining that enslaved people, just like animals, had no recognized kinship ties ensured that human beings could be bought and sold at will to pay debts, buy more acres or save storied universities like Georgetown from closing. Laws barred enslaved people from making wills or owning property, distinguishing black people in America from every other group on these shores and assuring that everything of value black people managed to accrue would add to the wealth of those who enslaved them. At the time of the Civil War, the value of the enslaved human beings held as property added up to more than all of this nations’ railroads and factories combined. And yet, enslaved people saw not a dime of this wealth. They owned nothing and were owed nothing from all that had been built from their toil. Slavery’s demise provided this nation the chance for redemption. Out of the ashes of sectarian strife, we could have birthed a new country, one that recognized the humanity and natural rights of those who helped forge this country, one that attempted to atone and provide redress for the unspeakable atrocities committed against black people in the name of profit. We could have finally, 100 years after the Revolution, embraced its founding ideals. And, oh so briefly, during the period known as Reconstruction, we moved toward that goal. The historian Eric Foner refers to these 12 years after the Civil War as this nation’s second founding, because it is here that America began to redeem the grave sin of slavery. Congress passed amendments abolishing human bondage, enshrining equal protection before the law in the Constitution and guaranteeing black men the right to vote. This nation witnessed its first period of biracial governance as the formerly enslaved were elected to public offices at all levels of government. For a fleeting moment, a few white men listened to the pleas of black people who had fought for the Union and helped deliver its victory. Land in this country has always meant wealth and, more important, independence. Millions of black people, liberated with not a cent to their name, desperately wanted property so they could work, support themselves and be left alone. Black people implored federal officials to take the land confiscated from enslavers who had taken up arms against their own country and grant it to those who worked it for generations. They were asking to, as the historian Robin D.G. Kelley puts it, “inherit the earth they had turned into wealth for idle white people.” In January 1865, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Order 15, providing for the distribution of hundreds of thousands of acres of former Confederate land issued in 40-acre tracts to newly freed people along coastal South Carolina and Georgia. But just four months later, in April, Lincoln was assassinated. Andrew Johnson, the racist, pro-Southern vice president who took over, immediately reneged upon this promise of 40 acres, overturning Sherman’s order. Most white Americans felt that black Americans should be grateful for their freedom, that the bloody Civil War had absolved any debt. The government confiscated the land from the few formerly enslaved families who had started to eke out a life away from the white whip and gave it back to the traitors. And with that, the only real effort this nation ever made to compensate black Americans for 250 years of chattel slavery ended. Freed people, during and after slavery, tried again and again to compel the government to provide restitution for slavery, to provide at the very least a pension for those who spent their entire lives working for no pay. They filed lawsuits. They organized to lobby politicians. And every effort failed. To this day, the only Americans who have ever received government restitution for slavery were white enslavers in Washington, D.C., who were compensated for their loss of human property. The way we are taught this in school, Lincoln “freed the slaves,” and then the nearly four million people who the day before had been treated as property suddenly enjoyed the privileges of being Americans like everyone else. We are not prodded to contemplate what it means to achieve freedom without a home to live in, without food to eat, a bed to sleep on, clothes for your children or money to buy any of it. Narratives collected of formerly enslaved people during the Federal Writers’ Project of the 1930s reveal the horrors of massive starvation, of “liberated” black people seeking shelter in burned-out buildings and scrounging for food in decaying fields before eventually succumbing to the heartbreak of returning to bend over in the fields of their former enslavers, as sharecroppers, just so they would not die. “With the advent of emancipation,” writes the historian Keri Leigh Merritt, “blacks became the only race in the U.S. ever to start out, as an entire people, with close to zero capital.” In 1881, Frederick Douglass, surveying the utter privation in which the federal government left the formerly enslaved, wrote: “When the Hebrews were emancipated, they were told to take spoil from the Egyptians. When the serfs of Russia were emancipated, they were given three acres of ground upon which they could live and make a living. But not so when our slaves were emancipated. They were sent away empty-handed, without money, without friends and without a foot of land on which they could live and make a living. Old and young, sick and well, were turned loose to the naked sky, naked to their enemies.” Just after the federal government decided that black people were undeserving of restitution, it began bestowing millions of acres in the West to white Americans under the Homestead Act, while also enticing white foreigners to immigrate with the offer of free land. From 1868 to 1934, the federal government gave away 246 million acres in 160-acre tracts, nearly 10 percent of all the land in the nation, to more than 1.5 million white families, native-born and foreign. As Merritt points out, some 46 million American adults today, nearly 20 percent of all American adults, descend from those homesteaders. “If that many white Americans can trace their legacy of wealth and property ownership to a single entitlement program,” Merritt writes, “then the perpetuation of black poverty must also be linked to national policy.” The federal government turned its back on its financial obligations to four million newly liberated people, and then it left them without protection as well, as white rule was reinstated across the South starting in the 1880s. Federal troops pulled out of the South, and white Southerners overthrew biracial governance using violence, coups and election fraud. The campaigns of white terror that marked the period after Reconstruction, known as Redemption, once again guaranteed an exploitable, dependent labor force for the white South. Most black Southerners had no desire to work on the same forced-labor camps where they had just been enslaved. But white Southerners passed state laws that made it a crime if they didn’t sign labor contracts with white landowners or changed employers without permission or sold cotton after sunset, and then as punishment for these “crimes,” black people were forcibly leased out to companies and individuals. Through sharecropping and convict leasing, black people were compelled back into quasi slavery. This arrangement ensured that once-devasted towns like Greenwood, Miss., were again able to call themselves the cotton capitals of the world, and companies like United States Steel secured a steady supply of unfree black laborers who could be worked to death, in what Douglass A. Blackmon, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, calls “slavery by another name.” Yet black Americans persisted, and despite the odds, some managed to acquire land, start businesses and build schools for their children. But it was the most prosperous black people and communities that elicited the most vicious response. Lynchings, massacres and generalized racial terrorism were regularly deployed against black people who had bought land, opened schools, built thriving communities, tried to organize sharecroppers’ unions or opened their own businesses, depriving white owners of economic monopolies and the opportunity to cheat black buyers. At least 6,500 black people were lynched from the end of the Civil War to 1950, an average of nearly two a week for nine decades. Nearly five black people, on average, have been killed a week by law enforcement since 2015. The scale of the destruction during the 1900s is incalculable. Black farms were stolen, shops burned to the ground. Entire prosperous black neighborhoods and communities were razed by white mobs from Florida to North Carolina to Atlanta to Arkansas. One of the most infamous of these, and yet still widely unknown among white Americans, occurred in Tulsa, Okla., when gangs of white men, armed with guns supplied by public officials, destroyed a black district so successful that it was known as Black Wall Street. They burned more than 1,200 homes and businesses, including a department store, a library and a hospital, and killed hundreds who it is believed were buried in mass graves. In 2001, a commission on the massacre recommended that the state pay financial restitution for the victims, but the State Legislature refused. And this is the place that in the midst of weeks of protests crying out for black lives to matter, Donald Trump, nearly 100 years later, chose to restart his campaign rallies. Even black Americans who did not experience theft and violence were continuously deprived of the ability to build wealth. They were denied entry into labor unions and union jobs that ensured middle-class wages. North and South, racist hiring laws and policies forced them into service jobs, even when they earned college degrees. They were legally relegated into segregated, substandard neighborhoods and segregated, substandard schools that made it impossible to compete economically even had they not faced rampant discrimination in the job market. In the South, for most of the period after the Civil War until the 1960s, nearly all the black people who wanted to earn professional degrees — law, medical and master’s degrees — had to leave the region to do so even as white immigrants attended state colleges in the former Confederacy that black American tax dollars helped pay for. As part of the New Deal programs, the federal government created redlining maps, marking neighborhoods where black people lived in red ink to denote that they were uninsurable. As a result, 98 percent of the loans the Federal Housing Administration insured from 1934 to 1962 went to white Americans, locking nearly all black Americans out of the government program credited with building the modern (white) middle class. “At the very moment a wide array of public policies was providing most white Americans with valuable tools to advance their social welfare — ensure their old age, get good jobs, acquire economic security, build assets and gain middle-class status — most black Americans were left behind or left out,” the historian Ira Katznelson writes in his book, “When Affirmative Action Was White.” “The federal government … functioned as a commanding instrument of white privilege.” In other words, while black Americans were being systematically, generationally deprived of the ability to build wealth, while also being robbed of the little they had managed to gain, white Americans were not only free to earn money and accumulate wealth with exclusive access to the best jobs, best schools, best credit terms, but they were also getting substantial government help in doing so. The civil rights movement ostensibly ended white advantage by law. And in the gauzy way white Americans tend to view history, particularly the history of racial inequality, the end of legal discrimination, after 350 years, is all that was required to vanquish this dark history and its effects. Changing the laws, too many Americans have believed, marked the end of the obligation. But civil rights laws passed in the 1960s merely guaranteed black people rights they should have always had. They dictated that from that day forward, the government would no longer sanction legal racial discrimination. But these laws did not correct the harm nor restore what was lost. Brown v. Board of Education did not end segregated and unequal schools; it just ended segregation in the law. It took court orders and, at times, federal troops to see any real integration. Nevertheless, more than six decades after the nation’s highest court proclaimed school segregation unconstitutional, black children remain as segregated from white kids as they were in the early 1970s. There has never been a point in American history where even half the black children in this country have attended a majority-white school. Making school segregation illegal did nothing to repay black families for the theft of their educations or make up for generations of black Americans, many of them still living, who could never go to college because white officials believed that only white students needed a high school education and so refused to operate high schools for black children. As late as the 1930s, most communities in the South, where the vast majority of black Americans lived, failed to provide a single public high school for black children, according to “The Education of Blacks in the South, 1860-1935,” by the historian James D. Anderson. Heavily black Richmond County in Georgia, for instance, did not provide a four-year black high school from 1897 to 1945. The Fair Housing Act prohibited discrimination in housing, but it did not reset real estate values so that homes in redlined black neighborhoods whose prices were artificially deflated would be valued the same as identical homes in white neighborhoods, which had been artificially inflated. It did not provide restitution for generations of black homeowners forced into predatory loans because they had been locked out of the prime credit market. It did not repay every black soldier who returned from World War II to find that he could not use his G.I. Bill to buy a home for his family in any of the new whites-only suburbs subsidized by the same government he fought for. It did not break up the still-entrenched housing segregation that took decades of government and private policy to create. Lay those redlining maps over almost any city in America with a significant black population, and you will see that the government-sanctioned segregation patterns remain stubbornly intact and that those same communities bore the brunt of the predatory lending and foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s that stole years of black homeownership and wealth gains. Making employment discrimination illegal did not come with a check for black Americans to compensate for all the high-paying jobs they were legally barred from, for the promotions they never got solely because of their race, for the income and opportunities lost to the centuries of discrimination. Nor did these laws end ongoing discrimination any more than speed limits without enforcement stop people from driving too fast. These laws opened up opportunities for limited numbers of black Americans while largely leaving centuries of meticulously orchestrated inequities soundly in place, but now with the sheen of colorblind magnanimity. The inclination to bandage over and move on is a definitive American feature when it comes to anti-black racism and its social and material effects. A joint 2019 study by faculty members at Yale University’s School of Management, Department of Psychology and Institute for Social and Policy Studies describes this phenomenon this way: “A firm belief in our nation’s commitment to racial egalitarianism is part of the collective consciousness of the United States of America. … We have a strong and persistent belief that our national disgrace of racial oppression has been overcome, albeit through struggle, and that racial equality has largely been achieved.” The authors point out how white Americans love to play up moments of racial progress like the Emancipation Proclamation, Brown v. Board of Education and the election of Barack Obama, while playing down or ignoring lynching, racial apartheid or the 1985 bombing of a black neighborhood in Philadelphia. “When it comes to race relations in the United States … most Americans hold an unyielding belief in a specific, optimistic narrative regarding racial progress that is robust to counterexamples: that society has come a very long way already and is moving rapidly, perhaps naturally toward full racial equality.” This remarkable imperviousness to facts when it comes to white advantage and architected black disadvantage is what emboldens some white Americans to quote the passage from Martin Luther King’s 1963 “I Have A Dream” speech about being judged by the content of your character and not by the color of your skin. It’s often used as a cudgel against calls for race-specific remedies for black Americans — while ignoring the part of that same speech where King says black people have marched on the capital to cash “a check which has come back marked ‘insufficient funds.’” King has been evoked continuously during this season of protests, sometimes to defend those who looted and torched buildings, sometimes to condemn them. But in this time of foment, there has been an astounding silence around his most radical demands. The seldom-quoted King is the one who said that the true battle for equality, the actualization of justice, required economic repair. After watching Northern cities explode even as his movement’s efforts to pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act came to fruition, King gave a speech in 1967 in Atlanta before the Hungry Club Forum, a secret gathering of white politicians and civil rights leaders. King said: “For well now 12 years, the struggle was basically a struggle to end legal segregation. In a sense it was a struggle for decency. It was a struggle to get rid of all of the humiliation and the syndrome of depravation surrounding the system of legal segregation. And I need not remind you that those were glorious days. … It is now a struggle for genuine equality on all levels, and this will be a much more difficult struggle. You see, the gains in the first period, or the first era of struggle, were obtained from the power structure at bargain rates; it didn’t cost the nation anything to integrate lunch counters. It didn’t cost the nation anything to integrate hotels and motels. It didn’t cost the nation a penny to guarantee the right to vote. Now we are in a period where it will cost the nation billions of dollars to get rid of poverty, to get rid of slums, to make quality integrated education a reality. This is where we are now. Now we’re going to lose some friends in this period. The allies who were with us in Selma will not all stay with us during this period. We’ve got to understand what is happening. Now they often call this the white backlash. … It’s just a new name for an old phenomenon. The fact is that there has never been any single, solid, determined commitment on the part of the vast majority of white Americans to genuine equality for Negroes.” A year later, in March 1968, just a month before his assassination, in a speech to striking, impoverished black sanitation workers in Memphis, King said: “Now our struggle is for genuine equality, which means economic equality. For we know that it isn’t enough to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn’t have enough money to buy a hamburger?” As we focus on police violence, we cannot ignore an even starker indication of our societal failures: Racial income disparities today look no different than they did the decade before King’s March on Washington. In 1950, according to a forthcoming study by the economists Moritz Schularick, Moritz Kuhn and Ulrike Steins in The Journal of Political Economy, black median household income was about half that of white Americans, and today it remains so. More critical, the racial wealth gap is about the same as it was in the 1950s as well. The typical black household today is poorer than 80 percent of white households. “No progress has been made over the past 70 years in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households,” according to the study. And yet most Americans are in an almost pathological denial about the depth of black financial struggle. That 2019 Yale University study, called “The Misperception of Racial Economic Inequality,” found that Americans believe that black households hold $90 in wealth for every $100 held by white households. The actual amount is $10. About 97 percent of study participants overestimated black-white wealth equality, and most assumed that highly educated, high-income black households were the most likely to achieve economic parity with white counterparts. That is also wrong. The magnitude of the wealth gap only widens as black people earn more income. “These data suggest that Americans are largely unaware of the striking persistence of racial economic inequality in the United States,” the study’s authors write. Americans, they write, tend to explain away or justify persistent racial inequality by ignoring the “tailwinds that have contributed to their economic success while justifying inequalities of wealth and poverty by invoking the role of individuals’ traits and skills as explanations for these disparities.” They use the exceptional examples of very successful black people to prove that systemic racism does not hold black Americans back and point to the large numbers of impoverished black people as evidence that black people are largely responsible for their own struggles. In 2018, Duke University’s Samuel DuBois Cook Center on Social Equity and the Insight Center for Community Economic Development published a report called “What We Get Wrong About Closing the Racial Wealth Gap” that examined the common misperceptions about the causes of the racial wealth gap and presented data and social-science research that refutes them all. The study shows that the racial wealth gap is not about poverty. Poor white families earning less than $27,000 a year hold nearly the same amount of wealth as black families earning between $48,000 and $76,000 annually. It’s not because of black spending habits. Black Americans have lower incomes over all but save at a slightly higher rate than white Americans with similar incomes. It’s not that black people need to value education more. Black parents, when controlling for household type and socioeconomic status, actually offer more financial support for their children’s higher education than white parents do, according to the study. And some studies have shown that black youths, when compared with white youths whose parents have similar incomes and education levels, are actually more likely to go to college and earn additional credentials. But probably most astounding to many Americans is that college simply does not pay off for black Americans the way it does for other groups. Black college graduates are about as likely to be unemployed as white Americans with a high school diploma, and black Americans with a college education hold less wealth than white Americans who have not even completed high school. Further, because black families hold almost no wealth to begin with, black students are the most likely to borrow money to pay for college and then to borrow more. That debt, in turn, means that black students cannot start saving immediately upon graduation like their less-debt-burdened peers. It’s not a lack of homeownership. While it’s true that black Americans have the lowest homeownership rates in the nation, simply owning a home is not the same asset that it is for white Americans. Black Americans get higher mortgage rates even with equal credit worthiness, and homes in black neighborhoods do not appreciate at the same rate as those in white areas, because housing prices are still driven by the racial makeup of communities. As the Duke University economist William Darity Jr., the study’s lead author, points out, the ability to purchase a home in the first place is seldom a result of just the hard work and frugality of the buyer. “It’s actually parental and grandparental wealth that facilitates the acquisition of a home.” It’s not because a majority of black families are led by a single mother. White single women with children hold the same amount of wealth as single black women with no children, and the typical white single parent has twice the wealth of the typical two-parent black family. To summarize, none of the actions we are told black people must take if they want to “lift themselves” out of poverty and gain financial stability — not marrying, not getting educated, not saving more, not owning a home — can mitigate 400 years of racialized plundering. Wealth begets wealth, and white Americans have had centuries of government assistance to accumulate wealth, while the government has for the vast history of this country worked against black Americans doing the same. “The cause of the gap must be found in the structural characteristics of the American economy, heavily infused at every point with both an inheritance of racism and the ongoing authority of white supremacy,” the authors of the Duke study write. “There are no actions that black Americans can take unilaterally that will have much of an effect on reducing the wealth gap. For the gap to be closed, America must undergo a vast social transformation produced by the adoption of bold national policies.” At the center of those policies must be reparations. “The process of creating the racial wealth chasm begins with the failure to provide the formerly enslaved with the 40 acres they were promised,” Darity told me. “So the restitution has never been given, and it’s 155 years overdue.” Darity has been studying and advocating reparations for 30 years, and this spring he and his partner, A. Kirsten Mullen, published the book “From Here to Equality: Reparations for Black Americans in the 21st Century.” Both history and road map, the book answers the questions about who should receive reparations and how a program would work. I will not spend much time on that here, except to make these few points. Reparations are not about punishing white Americans, and white Americans are not the ones who would pay for them. It does not matter if your ancestors engaged in slavery or if you just immigrated here two weeks ago. Reparations are a societal obligation in a nation where our Constitution sanctioned slavery, Congress passed laws protecting it and our federal government initiated, condoned and practiced legal racial segregation and discrimination against black Americans until half a century ago. And so it is the federal government that pays. Reparations would go to any person who has documentation that he or she identified as a black person for at least 10 years before the beginning of any reparations process and can trace at least one ancestor back to American slavery. Reparations should include a commitment to vigorously enforcing existing civil rights prohibitions against housing, educational and employment discrimination, as well as targeted investments in government-constructed segregated black communities and the segregated schools that serve a disproportionate number of black children. But critically, reparations must include individual cash payments to descendants of the enslaved in order to close the wealth gap. The technical details, frankly, are the easier part. The real obstacle, the obstacle that we have never overcome, is garnering the political will — convincing enough Americans that the centuries-long forced economic disadvantage of black Americans should be remedied, that restitution is owed to people who have never had an equal chance to take advantage of the bounty they played such a significant part in creating. This country can be remarkably generous. Each year Congress allocates money — this year $5 million — to help support Holocaust survivors living in America. In backing the funding measure, Representative Richard E. Neal, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in 2018 that this country has a “responsibility to support the surviving men and women of the Holocaust and their families.” And he is right. It is the moral thing to do. And yet Congress has refused for three decades to pass H.R. 40, a bill to simply study the issue of reparations. Its drafter, Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat and descendant of enslaved Americans, died in 2019 — during the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first Africans enslaved in Virginia — without the bill ever making it out of committee. There are living victims of racial apartheid and terrorism born in this country, including civil rights activists who lost their homes and jobs fighting to make this country a democracy, who have never received any sort of restitution for what they endured. Soon, like their enslaved ancestors, they will all be dead, too, and then we’ll hear the worn excuse that this country owes no reparations because none of the victims are still alive. Darity and Mullen call this the “delay until death” tactic. Procrastination, they say, does not erase what is owed. The coronavirus pandemic has dispatched the familiar lament that even if it is the right thing to do, this nation simply cannot afford to make restitution to the 40 million descendants of American slavery. It took Congress just a matter of weeks to pass a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill to help families and businesses struggling from the Covid-19 shutdowns. When, then, will this nation pass a stimulus package to finally respond to the singularity of black suffering? Colossal societal ruptures have been the only things potent enough to birth transformative racial change in this country, and perhaps a viral pandemic colliding with our nation’s 400-year racial one has forced that type of rupture today. Maybe it had to be this way; this deep and collective suffering was necessary for white Americans to feel enough of the pain that black Americans have always known to tilt the scale. With Covid-19, black Americans face a financial catastrophe unlike any in nearly a century. Black Americans had already lost the largest share of their wealth of all racial groups as a result of the last recession and have struggled the most to recover. They are the only racial group whose household median income is less than it was in 2000. Today already more than half of black adults are out of work. Black businesses are withering. Their owners were almost completely shut out of the federal paycheck-protection program — just 12 percent of black and Latino business owners who applied for the small-business loans received the full amounts they requested, according to a Global Strategy Group survey last month. Nearly half the respondents said they would most likely shutter permanently within six months. Black children are expected to lose 10 months’ worth of academic gains because of school closures, more than any other group, and yet they attend the schools with the least resources already, schools that will have even fewer resources as states slash spending to make up for budget shortfalls. One in five black homeowners and one in four renters have missed at least one home payment since the shutdowns began — the highest of all racial groups. The pandemic, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, a scholar of social movements and racial inequality at Princeton University, told me, “has pulled what is hidden and buried on the bottom to the surface so that it can’t actually be ignored. It is a radicalizing factor because conditions that have been so dire, now combined with revolts in the street, might lead one to believe that not only is the society unraveling, but it might cause you to question what foundation it was built upon in the first place.” Race-neutral policies simply will not address the depth of disadvantage faced by people this country once believed were chattel. Financial restitution cannot end racism, of course, but it can certainly mitigate racism’s most devastating effects. If we do nothing, black Americans may never recover from this pandemic, and they will certainly never know the equality the nation has promised. So we are left with a choice. Will this moment only feel different? Or will it actually be different? If black lives are to truly matter in America, this nation must move beyond slogans and symbolism. Citizens don’t inherit just the glory of their nation, but its wrongs too. A truly great country does not ignore or excuse its sins. It confronts them and then works to make them right. If we are to be redeemed, if we are to live up to the magnificent ideals upon which we were founded, we must do what is just. It is time for this country to pay its debt. It is time for reparations.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Over the pandemic-filled last four months, one thing’s become clear: Face masks can slow the spread of coronavirus and help to flatten the curve. The only issue? Mask-wearing is starting to look like a giant collective action problem — and many Americans are refusing to cooperate. For months, scientists and doctors waffled about the usefulness of masks. The Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, repeatedly told Americans not to buy or wear them if they had no COVID-19 symptoms; in March, Anthony Fauci, one of the top White House advisors on the pandemic, told 60 Minutes that “there’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.” But that messaging began to change as new research emerged on masks’ efficacy, and as countries with widespread mask use — like Japan and South Korea — appeared to squash the outbreak more quickly. In early April, the CDC reversed their recommendation, encouraging “cloth face coverings” as a voluntary health measure. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization did the same, advising the general public to wear “non-medical masks” wherever there is widespread transmission of the virus. According to a growing consensus, the coronavirus travels in droplets spewed from peoples’ mouths when they talk, cough, or breathe. And the latest research indicates that while homemade masks don’t protect the wearer much from virus-laden particles coming in, they do keep those droplets from spilling out. (Medical-grade masks like N95s, on the other hand, do both.) “If you’re wearing a mask, you’re mainly doing it to protect everybody else around you,” said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology and neural science at New York University. We would be better off if everyone wore masks, but there’s a small cost to each person that wears them: fogged-up glasses, irritated skin, or just the annoyance of putting it on and taking off. That means there’s an incentive to “free-ride” — if everyone else wears a mask, their caution keeps you safe and spares you the trouble of having to wear one yourself. But the more people free-ride, the more everyone is at risk. In psychology, this type of scenario is known as a collective action problem, or social dilemma. These problems have plagued society for decades, particularly when it comes to the environment. The ecologist Garrett Hardin famously wrote about the “tragedy of the commons,” or the dangers that result when everyone tries to free-ride on one shared resource, like an open pasture or a lake full of fish. Climate change, meanwhile, may be the most notorious collective action problem of all, since it requires the cooperation of every country on the planet. America has a patchy record with collective action. It may not be a coincidence that the United States is the only country in the world that’s trying to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which calls on nations to cooperate to fight dangerous climate change, or that we have an uneven history of vaccinating children. Americans, it seems, don’t always like being told what to do, even if it’s in the best interest of their communities. Part of the problem is the deep partisan divisions in the U.S. Republicans are more likely to be individualists, valuing personal choice and freedoms; Democrats are more likely to look at how communities will be affected as a whole. These divisions have shown up during the pandemic, sometimes in unexpected ways. According to an analysis by Peter Sharkey, professor of sociology at Princeton University, one of the strongest predictors of compliance with social distancing is belief in climate change — those who accept that climate change is happening, and is human-caused, are more likely to stay at home. Similarly, an April poll by Morning Consult found that climate skeptics are much less likely to wear masks than those “concerned” about climate change. People worried about one collective action problem (climate change) appear more likely to be worried about another (COVID-19). Van Bavel, the psychology professor, says that polarization doesn’t automatically mean that these problems can’t be addressed. In many cases, social norms and sanctions (think public shaming) can encourage cooperation. For example, secondhand smoke is a collective action problem, but one that has, at least to some extent, been “solved”: Nonpartisan norms and regulations control where and how individuals can smoke so that they don’t create respiratory problems for others. Another way to encourage cooperation is through role-modeling. “If somebody you look to and respect and trust is wearing a mask, lots of research suggests you’re going to be more likely to wear one,” Van Bavel said. Unfortunately, though, that trend cuts both ways — elite figures can also undermine cooperation when they eschew social norms. That has been the case for many prominent Republican leaders during the crisis. President Trump, for example, has repeatedly refused to wear a mask in front of cameras, even though reports say that he sometimes wears one in private; in a rambling interview with the Wall Street Journal last week, he also claimed that Americans wear masks not to protect themselves, but to signal disapproval of him. But as evidence accumulates in support of masks, some Republicans are changing their tune. In Texas, Governor Greg Abbott spent months refusing calls by mayors to allow mandates for mask-wearing in public spaces, saying that it might infringe on personal liberties. But, in light of Texas’ skyrocketing coronavirus cases and a desire to keep businesses open, he has reversed this position. Many other governors across the country have also recommended or mandated the use of masks. Now, the U.S. seems to be moving into a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic: Counties and states are focusing less on forced social cohesion through stay-at-home orders and more on individual assessments of risk. As stores and restaurants reopen, people are encouraged to make decisions for themselves about how — and when — to leave their homes. But mask-wearing can’t be boiled down to a personal decision if we want to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It’s not the first collective action problem to stymie the country, and unfortunately, it won’t be the last. According to Sharkey, the roots of Americans’ stubbornness on collective action go much deeper than COVID-19. It might take better role models, firmer regulations, and stronger social norms, but to address the pandemic — and combat even larger issues, like climate change — Americans are going to have to figure out a way to put society’s interests above their own.", "output": "left"}

Sen. Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, spearheaded the legislation in the wake of George Floyd's death and nationwide protests demanding racial justice -- including activists' calls to dismantle police departments. He framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color. SENATE DEMOCRATS RIP GOP POLICE REFORM BILL EVEN BEFORE PLAN UNVEILED \"The answer to the question of which side do you support is 'I support America,'\" Scott, R-S.C. said, \"And if you support America you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority. If you support America, that means you know that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation want to do their job, go home to their family. It is not a binary choice. This legislation encompasses that spirit.\" Scott said the overwhelming number of officers in America are good people. But he acknowledged the real fears people of color have about encountering the police. \"We hear you. We're listening to your concerns,\" said Scott, who recalled his own \"driving while black\" experiences of being stopped seven times in one year. \"The George Floyd incident certainly accelerated this conversation.\" Scott was joined by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sens. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., James Lankford, R-Okla. and Ben Sasse, R-Neb. to unveil the 106-page legislation. The package of reforms is called the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate Communities Everywhere (JUSTICE) Act. McConnell said he'll bring the legislation to a vote on the Senate floor by next week. \"We're serious about making a law here,\" he said at the Capitol press conference. Democrats have already unveiled their police reform legislation that's called the Justice in Policing Act. That legislation would lower the bar for police officers to face criminal prosecution by allowing charges not just in cases where alleged misconduct was intentional, but also in cases of reckless misconduct. It would also ban chokeholds, create a national database of cops who committed misconduct, boost police training and reform qualified immunity that can protect cops from lawsuits from victims of police brutality. Scott's bill doesn't ban chokeholds outright and doesn't end qualified immunity. Democrats have already panned the legislation as not going far enough. \"The Senate proposal of studies and reporting without transparency and accountability is inadequate,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the GOP legislation. \"The Senate’s so-called Justice Act is not action.\" The GOP legislation would beef up requirements for law enforcement to compile use of force reports under a new George Floyd and Walter Scott Notification Act, named for the Minnesota father whose May 25 death sparked worldwide protests over police violence, and Scott, the South Carolina man shot by police after a traffic stop in 2015, no relation to the senator. It would also establish the Breonna Taylor Notification Act to track “no-knock” warrants. Such warrants used to be rare, but the 26-year-old was killed after police in Kentucky used a no-knock warrant to enter her Louisville home. To focus on ending chokeholds, it encourages agencies to do away with the practice or risk losing federal funds. Many big-city departments have long stopped their use. It also provides funding for training to “de-escalate” situations and establish a “duty to intervene” protocol to prevent excessive force. SEN. TOM COTTON INTRODUCES BILL TO GIVE CASH REWARDS TO GOOD COPS But the GOP effort seeks to reach across the aisle to Democrats in several ways. It includes one long-sought measure to make lynching a federal hate crime and another to launch a study of the social status of black men and boys that has been touted by Pelosi. The Republican package also includes a bipartisan Senate proposal to establish a National Criminal Justice Commission Act and extends funding streams for various federal law enforcement programs, including the COPS program important to states. The package includes a mix of other proposals, including tapping the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture to create a law enforcement training curriculum on “the history of racism in the United States.” Another closes a loophole to prohibit federal law enforcement officers from engaging in sexual acts with those being arrested or in custody.

The collage did not clearly delineate between these images, and has since been replaced. In addition, a recent slideshow depicting scenes from Seattle mistakenly included a picture from St. Paul, Minnesota. Fox News regrets these errors. Seattle police say they have received reports of armed guards and potential extortion in a self-declared autonomous zone that spans several blocks and includes a now-closed precinct. “We’ve heard, anecdotally, reports of citizens and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate within this area. This is the crime of extortion. If anyone has been subjected to this, we need them to call 911,” Assistant Chief of Police Deanna Nollette said on Wednesday. Protesters calling to defund the police and make sweeping reforms to law enforcement tactics have declared a six-block region -- spanning 13th Avenue past 11th Avenue, near Cal Anderson Park, and from East Olive Street to East Pike Street -- the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone” (CHAZ). The region encompasses the SPD's East Precinct, which was abandoned by cops on Monday following days of violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters in the wake of George Floyd's death, as well as parts of Capitol Hill. Officers retreated from the area in an effort to quell the violence-- which included multiple shootings, one that was sparked after a man rammed his vehicle into a crowd of protesters. Police officers have deployed tear gas and pepper spray to disperse large groups of people. “We wanted to be able to facilitate and support peaceful demonstrations,” Nollette said. Demonstrations within the autonomous zone have been mostly peaceful, with no reports of violence, but police say armed guards have been surrounding the perimeter of the region and residents who live within the boundaries are \"forced to show ID to prove you “belong” there,\" a law enforcement official told Fox News. Speaking on the condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the unfolding situation, the official told Fox News some people living in the area -- which includes numerous bars, restaurants, businesses and private residences -- have been \"begging for help because they are not being allowed into their homes without ID.\" Police have been told to stay away from the region unless there is a call to 911 for help. TRUMP BLASTS 'RADICAL LEFT' DEMS IN SEATTLE, SAYS 'DOMESTIC TERRORISTS' TAKE HOLD OF CITY The official also added that leaders in the anti-cop zone are \"starting to extort money from the local businesses within the border for 'protection.'\" Mckenzie Diamond, who lives in the “Autonomous Zone,\" told Kiro 7 the experience has been \"a bit stressful.\" \"It’s like checking in with somebody to get into your own home,” Diamond told the news outlet. “Just making it so people can get into their buildings. Keep the zone however they want, and move the fencing so people can go home.\" “No one at these checkpoints has the legal authority to demand identification from anyone. We ask if anyone is subjected to these demands to call 911 and report the incident,” Nollette said. “While Washington is an open-carry state, there is no legal right for those arms to be used to intimidate community members,\" she told Komo News. Nollette also added that they are aware of threats to burn down the East Precinct, which she said \"would endanger residents, firefighters and businesses.” The police department is looking to start negotiations with the leaders of the protest movement to gain access to the police precinct but are unsure of who is leading the demonstrations. “It’s just a matter of establishing this dialogue. We’d love nothing more than to be able to open our precinct buildings,” Nollette said. “What we want to do is give an opportunity for everyone’s tempers to calm, and for us to approach the table with a view towards equality.\" Supporters of the movement have posted photos on social media depicting a large, but peaceful scene. Within the blockaded region, occupiers have set up tents, painted murals, and have music playing from speakers throughout the night. One resident in the area told police that there were \"tents lining my streets, barricades littered throughout the intersection by protestors, and civilians walking around with AR15s,\" an official told Fox News. \"And the noise has not stopped.\" Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins, whose firehouse is a few blocks from the region, has been one of the only city officials seen in the area working alongside demonstrators, according to Komo News. “Well, we got a team, we are working through this and there is some trust built and I don't want to compromise the trust,\" Scoggins told the news outlet. On Wednesday, President Trump demanded \"LAW & ORDER!\" in Seattle as the scene unfolded. \"Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle, run by Radical Left Democrats, of course,\" he said on Twitter. Trump lambasted Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, urging them to take control of the situation. \"Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will,\" Trump wrote. \"This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!\" One of the perceived leaders of the movement, Raz Simone, tweeted a response to Trump on Wednesday decrying that he is \"not a Terrorist Warlord.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"The President really put a hit on my head.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Democrats Unveil Police Reform Legislation Amid Protests Nationwide Updated at 1 p.m. ET In the wake of national protests following the death of George Floyd, House and Senate Democrats unveiled legislation on Monday that would bring about wide-ranging reforms to police departments across the country. The Democratic proposal, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, has more than 200 sponsors and marks one of the most comprehensive efforts in modern times to overhaul the way police do their jobs. It would prohibit the use of chokeholds, lower legal standards to pursue criminal and civil penalties for police misconduct, and ban no-knock warrants in drug-related cases. The plan would also create a national registry to track police misconduct. \"We can't settle for anything other than transformative structural change,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Monday while flanked by the bill's authors gathered to introduce the legislation. \"True justice can only be achieved with full, comprehensive action, that is what we are doing today. This is a first step; there is more to come.\" The Congressional Black Caucus and the House Judiciary Committee, as well as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, crafted the plan. They wrote their colleagues an emailed letter with an outline of the legislation on Saturday and urged them to join as co-sponsors. A Democratic congressional aide provided the letter and bill outline to NPR. \"Persistent, unchecked bias in policing and a history of lack of accountability is wreaking havoc on the black community. Cities are literally on fire with the pain and anguish wrought by the violence visited upon black and brown bodies,\" the sponsors said, naming black people who have died in cases tied to police brutality. \"While there is no single policy prescription that will erase the decades of systemic racism and excessive policing — it's time we create structural change with meaningful reforms.\" Bill could face Republican opposition Last week, Pelosi said she asked the Congressional Black Caucus to lead the process of drafting a legislative response. Democrats hope to calm a national outcry sparked by the May 25 death of Floyd, who was killed in Minneapolis police custody. Democrats sorted through dozens of proposals to address policing issues, including excessive use of force and racial profiling. And while there is some degree of bipartisan support for reviewing the tactics that led to Floyd's death, cooperation is less certain on a legislative solution. Republicans were absent from Democratic talks to develop the legislation and for now are unlikely to support it. \"I think we can easily find common ground on both sides and we can do it swiftly, but it's more difficult if you're away,\" House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters Thursday, referencing an extended House recess as a result of the pandemic. \"Members of Congress should not be called back for one week and say, 'Here are all the bills.' \" The Democratic led-House is expected to take up the measure later this month, but its fate is much less clear in the Republican-controlled Senate. For now, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and many Republicans have acknowledged \"egregious wrongs\" in police brutality cases. \"It's certainly something that we need to take a look at,\" McConnell told reporters last week. \"We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on.\" Congress has often struggled to address policing issues on a bipartisan basis as some say decisions about policing tactics, training and strategies should be solved at the state and local level. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced a June 16 hearing on police use of force to \"shine a bright light on the problems associated with Mr. Floyd's death, with the goal of finding a better way forward for our nation.\" Many Democrats say it is critical that this legislation be comprehensive and ambitious, even if Senate Republicans refuse to consider the bill. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Democrats need to make sure the package reflects the demands of the people protesting and calling for change. \"The American public is going to get behind it,\" Cleaver said in an interview with NPR. \"They are saying they want substantive change. They want reform. Reforms that perhaps in the past people have been afraid to embrace.\" Cleaver said serving in Congress requires a certain level of courage to vote for legislation that may be controversial. He said in the past, lawmakers from both parties have shied away from addressing systemic issues with policing but he believes this moment is different. The Missouri Democrat, a former mayor of Kansas City, Mo., said the response to the killing of George Floyd gives Congress an opportunity to create uniform standards that help mayors and local leaders by giving them guidelines for conduct. He said federal laws can also provide political backup for local leaders when they meet resistance. \"I think that the federal government must express itself,\" Cleaver said. \"Local communities all around the country who might be reticent about doing things that they believe would be helpful can say, 'Hey, that's the law.' \" Debate about calls to \"defund the police\" The legislation does not address the growing movement among some protesters calling to defund police departments. California Rep. Karen Bass, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told reporters that the legislation aims instead to overhaul how policing is conducted. \"We feel it is transformative, that it will transform the relationships that our communities have with the police,\" Bass said. Democrats at Monday's press conference largely avoided addressing the concept of defunding the police or their support for that demand. Congressional Republicans and their campaign operations have already begun attacking Democrats over the demand to defund the police. Outside groups and the official campaign organizations for House and Senate Republicans have begun linking rank-and-file Democrats to the defund movement. President Trump has also weighed in. Democrats, like Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., dismissed the tactic as a \"predictable and hurtful\" way to undermine the legislation. \"The same way there have been efforts to undermine the Black Lives Matter movement and to co-opt the narrative of what is actually happening throughout our glow in this moment, that commentary is certainly not surprising,\" Pressley said in an interview with NPR. \"Those efforts are always underway; we will not allow that narrative to persist and to obstruct the work that we need to do as a legislative body.\" Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, released a statement on Monday saying he opposes defunding the police. He said he is supporting policies that would increase resources for programs outside of police departments to address societal issues \"so that officers can focus on the job of policing,\" as well as providing funding for body cameras and other measures inside police departments. Higher standards for police Bass said while she couldn't confirm any Republicans are on board with the proposal yet, she's holding out hope. She also noted that a wave of videos documenting new cases of police brutality at protests could provide new momentum for legislation. \"The world is watching the birth of a new movement in our country,\" Bass said Monday. The bill's authors say it addresses concerns of steep requirements to pursue penalties against police misconduct. It reforms qualified immunity for police officers, or their legal protection shield for certain actions, to allow individuals to recover damages when their constitutional rights are violated. And it lowers the \"mens rea\" standard in the U.S. code to a finding of an officer's recklessness. \"The current mens rea standard of 'willfulness' has made it extremely difficult to prosecute law enforcement officers,\" the bill's sponsors told their colleagues. Among the bill's other efforts: - It creates a National Police Misconduct Registry to track police misconduct and thwart officers from switching jurisdictions to avoid accountability. The plan also looks to improve police practices by mandating training on racial bias and the duty to intervene. - It also limits the transfer of military-grade weapons to state and local law enforcement agencies and requires the use of body cameras. - The legislation would also empower attorneys general and the Justice Department to play a much larger role in its oversight of police agencies. For example, it would create a grant program to allow attorneys general to independently investigate police misconduct and excessive use of force. And it would give the Justice Department greater powers to investigate and track cases. - It would also condition federal funding for state and local police agencies to their training and adoption of policies to combat racial bias and profiling, as well as ban \"no-knock\" warrants in drug-related cases and the use of choke-holds. - It also makes lynching a federal crime, a revival of legislation already approved in the House and currently stalled in the Senate following failed attempts to pass it. The House could take up the measure when it is due to return June 30. However, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters last week that lawmakers could return sooner to approve the plan.", "output": "left"}

Bush won't support Donald Trump’s reelection, report says George W. Bush will not support the re-election of Donald Trump, according to people familiar with his thinking, The New York Times reported Saturday. The paper said the former president and Texas governor won't vote for Trump's reelection and that his brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, \"isn't sure how he'll vote.\" The paper spotlights several members of the Republican Party who are dissenting from party lines, though Bush was the only prominent Texas politician mentioned. Freddy Ford, a spokesman for Bush, told The Texas Tribune that Bush would steer clear of speaking publicly on his presidential vote and called The New York Times assertion false. \"This is completely made up,\" Ford said in an email. \"He is retired from presidential politics and has not indicated how he will vote.\" It is unclear whether Bush will instead be voting for Joe Biden, Trump's Democratic rival. Both of the Bush brothers — and their parents, former President George H.W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush — said in 2016 they didn’t vote for Trump. But Trump endorsed Jeb’s son, George P. Bush, when he ran for reelection as Texas Land Commissioner in 2018. In 2014, before Jeb Bush ran for president (a race he lost to Trump), George P. told the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith he wouldn’t endorse his father. The paper said U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney won't endorse the president, nor will Cindy McCain, widow of U.S. Sen. John McCain. Military leaders are sharing their misgivings, too. William McRaven, the former University of Texas System chancellor and retired Navy admiral, has been vocally dismissive of Trump in the past. He told the Times that Trump isn't qualified for the office. “President Trump has shown he doesn’t have the qualities necessary to be a good commander in chief,” he said. Texas Sen.

Trump has been railing against the company since earlier this week, when it for the first time applied fact checks to two of his tweets. Those were about mail-in ballots. The flap comes at a fraught moment for Twitter and social media more generally. Debate is heating up about when and how much these companies should police the content on their platforms as coronavirus misinformation swirls and the 2020 U.S. presidential election looms. For Trump, the feud with Twitter serves as a convenient distraction from major challenges he faces heading into November, such as controlling a pandemic and dealing with soaring unemployment. The Trump tweet that was flagged Friday came amid days of violent protests over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. “These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won’t let that happen,” Trump tweeted about the protesters. “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!” The comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami’s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods. Twitter did not remove the tweet, saying it had determined it might be in the public interest to have it remain accessible. But the tweet was hidden so that a user looking at Trump’s timeline would have to click on the warning to see the original tweet. Hiding it also effectively demotes the tweet by limiting how users can retweet it and ensuring that Twitter algorithms don’t recommend it. Twitter said Friday it posted the warning label on Trump’s tweet “based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today,” but left it up “given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance.” A tweet using the same language as Trump’s was later posted on the official White House Twitter account, and Twitter eventually put a warning on that too. It was also posted on Facebook, which hasn’t taken any visible action on it. Twitter taking a harder line than Facebook on Trump’s posts likely has something to do with Twitter’s decision last year to stop taking political ads, said Melissa Ryan, CEO of consultancy group Card Strategies, which researches online disinformation and right-wing extremism. She said the coronavirus pandemic has also led Twitter to inch toward stronger enforcement of its policies at the same time that Trump’s tweets have “amped up in terms of crazy and intensity and disinformation.” “Twitter and Trump have been playing a game of chicken,” Ryan said. “It feels like they’ve both been moving toward this for a while.” Trump took to Twitter to complain, calling multiple times for the revocation of Section 230, part of a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications. That section generally protects social media platforms from liability for material users post on their platforms. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order challenging those protections. The order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies, though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress. The president and fellow conservatives have claimed for years that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them. But there is no evidence for this, and while the executives and many employees of Twitter, Facebook and Google may lean liberal, the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other. Twitter first outlined in early 2018 that it wouldn’t block world leaders from the platform or remove their controversial tweets. But it announced nearly a year ago that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. That followed complaints from Trump critics that the president has gotten a free pass from Twitter to post hateful messages and attack his enemies in ways they say could lead to violence. Twitter further clarified its rules in October, saying it will enforce its policies against any user who makes clear and direct threats of violence against a person, but carving out an exception for government officials’ “foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues.” The earlier tweets that Twitter flagged were not hidden but did come with an option to “get the facts about mail-in ballots,” a link that led to fact checks and news stories by media organizations. Those tweets called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Twitter’s decision to flag Trump’s tweets came as the president continued to use the platform to push a debunked conspiracy theory accusing MSNBC host and former congressman Joe Scarborough of killing a staffer in his Florida congressional office in 2001. Medical officials determined the staffer had an undiagnosed heart condition, passed out and hit her head as she fell. Scarborough, who was in Washington, not Florida, at the time, has urged the president to stop his baseless attacks. The staffer’s husband also recently demanded that Twitter remove the tweets. The company issued a statement expressing its regret to the husband but so far has taken no other action. Twitter’s decision also likely will be seized upon outside the U.S. to scrutinize the social media behavior of other world leaders. Israel has been waging its own pressure campaign on the company over it allowing Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to have an account. In a letter dated Sunday, an Israeli official wrote to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey complaining about Khamenei tweets that repeated comments he made in a recent speech in support of Palestinians that called Israel a “cancerous growth” that will be “uprooted and destroyed.” On the other hand, the company has removed tweets related to the coronavirus from the leaders of Brazil and Venezuela, and says it will remove content that has a call to action that poses a threat to people’s health or well being. It has also previously used the warning label for an elected official, Brazilian politician Osmar Terra, who tweeted that quarantine increases the spread of the virus. ——- AP writers Tali Arbel in New York and Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.", "output": "left"}

In response, more than 500 members of the National Guard were heading to the Twin Cities region, called in by Gov. Tim Walz, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported. Rioters broke into the precinct around 10 p.m. local time, after police on the rooftop previously tried to disperse a gathering crowd using \"flash bang\" shots and tear gas, according to reports. The rioters entered the building and sparked the fire after police officers on the roof were rescued by helicopter, reports said. A short time later, city officials warned the rioters that the risk of an explosion existed at the site because of unconfirmed reports that gas lines may have been cut, FOX 9 of the Twin Cities reported. Mayor Jacob Frey said police officers were evacuated from the building at his direction, the station reported. Frey said the fire department was working to respond to multiple arson fires in the city. He urged people to move away from the police precinct and made a call for unity. \"We all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents,\" the mayor said, according to FOX 9. \"And right now working together means clearing the area.\" The precinct is located only a short distance away from where Floyd died Monday. Video images showing Floyd lying in the street, with a police officer's knee against his neck, sparked outrage across the nation. Four police officers connected to the incident were fired Tuesday -- with Hennipen County Attorney Mike Freeman considering murder charges against them. At the request of President Trump, federal authorities are also looking into the case. Earlier Thursday evening, a separate fire erupted about two blocks from the police station -- with no apparent immediate signs of response from the city's fire department. On Wednesday, rioters were shown vandalizing the same police station that officers were defending Thursday night. Across the Twin Cities region, businesses were seen boarded up in a bid to prevent vandalism and looting. Around midday Thursday, dozens of looters rushed toward a Target store in an apparent attempt to loot it but were turned away by responding police, The Associated Press reported. The crowd then moved on to other nearby stores. Target, with corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, later announced it was temporarily closing about two dozen stores in the Twin Cities area.

Every human life has value and dignity, and losing so many aging Americans to this virulent disease is gut-wrenching. The point is not that older lives lost do not matter. The point is that as we make difficult public policy decisions about public health and reopening the economy, extraordinary efforts must be undertaken to mitigate the deadly impact of isolated hotspots that arise as the virus sweeps through communities that are exclusively populated by the most vulnerable members of our society. These numbers, released earlier this week, are staggering and important: New @FREOPP: Updated report on #COVID19 nursing home fatalities with the latest data as of Friday. https://t.co/ylZ5EqAzWY Nursing homes & assisted living facilities now represent 42% of all deaths from the coronavirus—up from 40% earlier this month—and 52% outside of NY state. pic.twitter.com/78N6vD5Afp — Avik Roy (@Avik) May 26, 2020 Remember that only 1.8% of U.S. residents live in nursing homes or assisted living facilities, and yet these facilities have tallied 42% of all #COVID19 deaths. — Avik Roy (@Avik) May 26, 2020 Roy later clarified that the actual percentage of Americans living in these facilities is 0.6 percent. New York leads the nation in the total number of statewide COVID deaths generally, as well as at nursing homes -- but its overall percentage may still look somewhat favorable due to its government's decision to alter the manner in which such deaths are counted. As the media flocked to cover this bogus story out of Florida (because of course they did), New York's apparent statistical sleight of hand has garnered relatively little attention. As we've covered, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and his team did an extraordinary job of recognizing and addressing COVID's unique threat to nursing homes, achieving impressive and life-saving results thus far. Florida's population is older and larger than New York's, yet its death toll is roughly one-tenth of the Empire State's. Thousands more people perished from the virus in New York nursing homes alone than in the entire state of Florida. Health policy expert Avik Roy, who published the tweets embedded above, adds additional insight based on the data: Recommended States like New York, New Jersey, and Michigan actually ordered nursing homes to accept patients with active COVID-19 infections who were being discharged from hospitals. The most charitable interpretation of these orders is that they were designed to ensure that states would not overcrowd their ICUs. But well after hospitalizations peaked, governors like New York’s Andrew Cuomo were doubling down on their mandates. As recently as April 23, Cuomo declared that nursing homes “don’t have a right to object” to accepting elderly patients with active COVID infections. “That is the rule and that is the regulation and they have to comply with that.” Only on May 10—after the deaths of nearly 3,000 New York residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities—did Cuomo stand down and partially rescind his order...Contrast the decisions by governors like Cuomo with those of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In Florida, all nursing home workers were required to be screened for COVID-19 symptoms before entering a facility. On March 15, before most states had locked down, DeSantis signed an executive order that banned nursing home visitations from friends and family, and also banned hospitals from discharging SARS-CoV-2-infected patients into long-term care facilities...While it is too late for thousands of nursing home residents who have already died, there is still time to protect the millions who remain, by learning from Florida’s example. Learning from one's mistakes should not include craven blame shift and purging the public record.

Pennsylvania, Georgia, Texas, and other states are doing the same. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conflating the results of two different types of coronavirus tests, distorting several important metrics and providing the country with an inaccurate picture of the state of the pandemic. We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The agency confirmed to The Atlantic on Wednesday that it is mixing the results of viral and antibody tests, even though the two tests reveal different information and are used for different reasons. This is not merely a technical error. States have set quantitative guidelines for reopening their economies based on these flawed data points. Several states—including Pennsylvania, the site of one of the country’s largest outbreaks, as well as Texas, Georgia, and Vermont—are blending the data in the same way. Virginia likewise mixed viral and antibody test results until last week, but it reversed course and the governor apologized for the practice after it was covered by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Atlantic. Maine similarly separated its data on Wednesday; Vermont authorities claimed they didn’t even know they were doing this. The widespread use of the practice means that it remains difficult to know exactly how much the country’s ability to test people who are actively sick with COVID-19 has improved. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Ashish Jha, the K. T. Li Professor of Global Health at Harvard and the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told us when we described what the CDC was doing. “How could the CDC make that mistake? This is a mess.” Viral tests, taken by nose swab or saliva sample, look for direct evidence of a coronavirus infection. They are considered the gold standard for diagnosing someone with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus: State governments consider a positive viral test to be the only way to confirm a case of COVID-19. Antibody tests, by contrast, use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past. A negative test result means something different for each test. If somebody tests negative on a viral test, a doctor can be relatively confident that they are not sick right now; if somebody tests negative on an antibody test, they have probably never been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus. (Or they may have been given a false result—antibody tests are notoriously less accurate on an individual level than viral tests.) The problem is that the CDC is clumping negative results from both tests together in its public reporting. Mixing the two tests makes it much harder to understand the meaning of positive tests, and it clouds important information about the U.S. response to the pandemic, Jha said. “The viral testing is to understand how many people are getting infected, while antibody testing is like looking in the rearview mirror. The two tests are totally different signals,” he told us. By combining the two types of results, the CDC has made them both “uninterpretable,” he said. The public-radio station WLRN, in Miami, first reported that the CDC was mixing viral and antibody test results. Pennsylvania’s and Maine’s decisions to mix the two tests have not been previously reported. Kristen Nordlund, a spokesperson for the CDC, told us that the inclusion of antibody data in Florida is one reason the CDC has reported hundreds of thousands more tests in Florida than the state government has. The agency hopes to separate the viral and antibody test results in the next few weeks, she said in an email. But until the agency does so, its results will be suspect and difficult to interpret, says William Hanage, an epidemiology professor at Harvard. In addition to misleading the public about the state of affairs, the intermingling “makes the lives of actual epidemiologists tremendously more difficult.” “Combining a test that is designed to detect current infection with a test that detects infection at some point in the past is just really confusing and muddies the water,” Hanage told us. The CDC stopped publishing anything resembling a complete database of daily test results on February 29. When it resumed publishing test data last week, a page of its website explaining its new COVID Data Tracker said that only viral tests were included in its figures. “These data represent only viral tests. Antibody tests are not currently captured in these data,” the page said as recently as May 18. Yesterday, that language was changed. All reference to disaggregating the two different types of tests disappeared. “These data are compiled from a number of sources,” the new version read. The text strongly implied that both types of tests were included in the count, but did not explicitly say so. The CDC’s data have also become more favorable over the past several days. On Monday, a page on the agency’s website reported that 10.2 million viral tests had been conducted nationwide since the pandemic began, with 15 percent of them—or about 1.5 million—coming back positive. But yesterday, after the CDC changed its terms, it said on the same page that 10.8 million tests of any type had been conducted nationwide. Yet its positive rate had dropped by a percent. On the same day it expanded its terms, the CDC added 630,205 new tests, but it added only 52,429 positive results. This is what concerns Jha. Because antibody tests are meant to be used on the general population, not just symptomatic people, they will, in most cases, have a lower percent-positive rate than viral tests. So blending viral and antibody tests “will drive down your positive rate in a very dramatic way,” he said. The absence of clear national guidelines has led to widespread confusion about how testing data should be reported. Pennsylvania reports negative viral and antibody tests in the same metric, a state spokesperson confirmed to us on Wednesday. The state has one of the country’s worst outbreaks, with more than 67,000 positive cases. But it has also slowly improved its testing performance, testing about 8,000 people in a day. Yet right now it is impossible to know how to interpret any of its accumulated results. Texas, where the rate of new COVID-19 infections has stubbornly refused to fall, is one of the most worrying states (along with Georgia). The Texas Observer first reported last week that the state was lumping its viral and antibody results together. On Tuesday, Governor Greg Abbott denied that the state was blending the results, but the Dallas Observer reports that it is still doing so. While the number of tests per day has increased in Texas, climbing to more than 20,000, the combined results mean that the testing data are essentially uninterpretable. It is impossible to know the true percentage of positive viral tests in Texas. It is impossible to know how many of the 718,000 negative results were not meant to diagnose a sick person. The state did not return a request for comment, nor has it produced data describing its antibody or viral results separately. (Some states, following guidelines from the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, report antibody-test positives as “probable” COVID-19 cases without including them in their confirmed totals.) Georgia is in a similar situation. It has also seen its COVID-19 infections plateau amid a surge in testing. Like Texas, it reported more than 20,000 new results on Wednesday, the majority of them negative. But because, according to The Macon Telegraph, it is also blending its viral and antibody results together, its true percent-positive rate is impossible to know. (The governor’s office did not return a request for comment.) These results damage the public’s ability to understand what is happening in any one state. On a national scale, they call the strength of America’s response to the coronavirus into question. The number of tests conducted nationwide each day has more than doubled in the past month, rising from about 147,000 a month ago to more than 413,000 on Wednesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project at The Atlantic, which compiles data reported by state and territorial governments. In the past week, the daily number of tests has grown by about 90,000. At the same time, the portion of tests coming back positive has plummeted, from a seven-day average of 10 percent at the month’s start to 6 percent on Wednesday. “The numbers have outstripped what I was expecting,” Jha said. “My sense is people are really surprised that we’ve moved as much as we have in such a short time period. I think we all expected a move and we all expected improvement, but the pace and size of that improvement has been a big surprise.” The intermingling of viral and antibody tests suggests that some of those gains might be illusory. If even a third of the country’s gain in testing has come by expanding antibody tests, not viral tests, then its ability to detect an outbreak is much smaller than it seems. There is no way to ascertain how much of the recent increase in testing is from antibody tests until the most populous states in the country—among them Texas, Georgia, and Pennsylvania—show their residents everything in the data.", "output": "left"}
