Their warnings come as the famous ball drop in New York's Times Square and many other big celebrations will be virtual this year. But gatherings at home and other places could accelerate the spread of COVID-19. \"It's very important to avoid large gatherings and small gatherings, and as we approach New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, we cannot let our guard down,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine warned. According to AAA, as many as 84.5 million Americans were expected to travel from December 23 to January 3 to celebrate the holidays and the New Year. \"It would be magical thinking to think we're not going to see a bump after all this travel around the holiday season with Christmas and New Year's,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said. LaPook is among many health officials concerned about large gatherings violating coronavirus protocols. And testing negative for COVID-19 doesn't make gatherings safe, LaPook said. \"The biggest misconception of this pandemic — and there's not even a close second — is that 'I got tested today and therefore I'm safe tomorrow or the next day.' Remember that the incubation period is 2 to 14 days,\" he said. Law enforcement is already tamping down on large gatherings. In Newark, New Jersey, this weekend, two women were arrested for hosting 200 people at a makeshift indoor bar at a warehouse. At the famous La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, customers reported an upcoming New Year's Eve secret indoor party to authorities. On Tuesday, the restaurant responded to backlash, writing that its invitation was misunderstood and that they \"have consistently taken the most drastic steps to ensure guest and employee safety.\" But invitations like one promoting a party in San Francisco are common across the United States. San Francisco police are warning of penalties for those breaking the state's rules. \"We're very concerned,\" Robert Rueca, the department's public information officer, told CBS News correspondent Nikki Battiste. \"The protocol has been to admonish someone or admonish people, giving them a warning at first. Sometimes, there isn't that chance to admonish someone, and we will issue a citation.\""}

Law enforcement and federal authorities in the US had already been investigating after a health center in the state said an employee admitted to deliberately spoiling 500 doses of the coronavirus vaccine. Aurora medical center, in Grafton, first reported that the doses of the Moderna vaccine had been spoiled on Saturday, saying a staff member had accidentally left them out of refrigeration overnight. On Wednesday, however, it said the doses appeared to have been spoiled deliberately. Police in Grafton, about 20 miles north of Milwaukee, said the department, the FBI and the Food and Drug Administration were investigating the case. A pharmacist at the suburban medical center deliberately removed hundreds of coronavirus vaccine doses from refrigeration and left them out overnight – twice, not just once as officials had initially believed, the health system’s chief medical officer said later on Thursday. Employees at the Aurora medical center in Grafton inoculated nearly 60 people with the ruined vaccine, not knowing the doses had been left out too long, rendering their shots less effective or ineffective, Jeff Bahr, the chief medical officer for Aurora Advocate Health, told reporters during a teleconference. The recipients shouldn’t be in any danger, he said, but the system is monitoring their conditions. The pharmacist intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration, Bahr said, but he declined to comment on the individual’s motive, saying the person has been fired and police are investigating. He did not identify the pharmacist and stressed that the facility’s security protocols are sound. “This was a situation involving a bad actor, as opposed to a bad process,” he said. Police said they were notified of the alleged tampering on Wednesday night, but that no other information would be immediately released. They declined to say if any arrests had been made. In a statement late on Wednesday, Aurora said the employee involved “acknowledged that they intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration”. Aurora said it had fired the person in question and referred the matter to the authorities. The statement said nothing about a possible motive for the action. “We continue to believe that vaccination is our way out of the pandemic. We are more than disappointed that this individual’s actions will result in a delay of more than 500 people receiving their vaccine,” the statement said. The tampering will delay inoculation for hundreds of people, Aurora Health officials said, in a state where 3,170 new cases were reported and 40 people died on Wednesday of Covid-19, according to the Washington Post’s coronavirus tracker. Leonard Peace, an FBI spokesman in Milwaukee, would not comment on the bureau’s involvement but said of the episode: “We’re aware of it.” Initiating an internal review on Monday, hospital officials said they were initially “led to believe” the incident was caused by “inadvertent human error”. The vials were removed on Friday and most were discarded on Saturday, with only a few still safe to administer, according to an earlier statement from the health system. Each vial has enough for 10 vaccinations but can sit at room temperature for only 12 hours. Two days later, the employee acknowledged having “intentionally removed the vaccine from refrigeration”, according to the hospital statement, the Washington Post reported."}

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Wednesday became the first Republican senator to publicly say he will object to the certification of the presidential election results when a joint session of Congress meets in one week to formally certify President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory over President Trump. Roughly a dozen Trump supporters in the House – led by Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama – have said they will challenge the slate of electors from six battleground states where Biden narrowly edged Trump in last month's election. But the challenge of at least one senator is needed for both houses of Congress to debate the objections. GROWING NUMBER OF HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S VICTORY OVER TRUMP Hawley, a conservative lawmaker and Trump supporter, said in a release issued Wednesday that in his objection he’ll highlight what he said was the failure of some states – most notably Pennsylvania – to follow their own election laws. A number of states – including Pennsylvania – allowed for a greater use of absentee balloting due to serious health concerns over in-person voting at polling stations amid the coronavirus pandemic. \"I cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws,\" the senator highlighted in a statement. Hawley also charged, \"I cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden. At the very least, Congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. But Congress has so far failed to act.\" He pointed out that \"following both the 2004 and 2016 elections, Democrats in Congress objected during the certification of electoral votes in order to raise concerns about election integrity. They were praised by Democratic leadership and the media when they did. And they were entitled to do so. But now those of us concerned about the integrity of this election are entitled to do the same.\" PENCE APPARENTLY DOESN'T BACK LAWMAKER'S PLAN TO OBJECT TO ELECTION RESULTS The president has repeatedly claimed he beat Biden, who topped the president by more than 7 million votes. Trump has charged that widespread voter fraud aided Biden’s victory. Trump has unsuccessfully urged states with GOP governors or Republican controlled legislatures to overturn Biden’s victories in their states. And dozens of legal challenges by the president and his allies have been shot down. Plus, Attorney General William Barr, who has since stepped down, said last month that his Justice Department has not seen fraud on the kind of scale that could flip the election. Trump met at the White House last week for a strategy session with some of the House Republicans who have said they will object to the election certification. Senate GOP leaders are against this effort to challenge Biden's win, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recognizing the former vice president’s victory, and behind closed doors urging Senate Republicans not to contest the election results. But with Hawley joining the small group of House Republicans in objecting, the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6 would be dissolved and the House and Senate would then meet separately for two hours to debate a contested state’s electoral vote. US DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OF QUESTIONING ELECTION INTEGRITY Each body would then vote whether to accept or reject that state’s slate of electoral votes. Then the House and Senate reconvene in the joint session. The last time this happened (and only the second time in U.S. history) was in January 2005, following President’ George W. Bush’s narrow reelection victory over Democratic challenger Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. One Senate Democrat – Sen. Barbara Boxer of California – and one House Democrat – Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones – objected. In 2017, a handful of House Democrats objected to Trump’s victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but no Senate Democrats joined them. A state’s slate of electoral votes would only tossed if both the House and Senate vote to do so. But with the Democrats controlling the House and most Senate Republicans not expected to back the push to contest the results, it’s extremely unlikely there would be enough votes to reject any state’s certification. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Hawley is the first GOP senator to say he’d object to the certification, Senator-elect Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Sen. Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas could potentially join their colleague from Missouri. Fox News Marisa Schultz and Tyler Olson contributed to this story."}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Coronavirus: Cases of new variant appear worldwide Cases of the more contagious variant of Covid-19 first identified in the UK have been confirmed in several European countries as well as Canada and Japan. Infections linked to people who arrived from the UK were reported in Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and France. A couple found infected in Ontario, Canada, had no known travel history or high-risk contacts, officials say. Japan is to ban most non-resident foreign nationals from entering the country for a month from Monday. Since reporting infections in five passengers who had all arrived from the UK, the country has confirmed two more cases, one of which is said to have been domestically transmitted. Meanwhile, several EU countries have started to vaccinate people against the virus ahead of a co-ordinated rollout across the whole bloc on Sunday. Health workers in north-east Germany said they were not prepared to wait another day to distribute the newly approved Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. They began by immunising elderly residents of a nursing home in Halberstadt. In Hungary, the state news agency said the first recipient of the vaccine was a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital. The authorities in Slovakia also said they had begun vaccinating. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has released a video on Twitter celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it a \"touching moment of unity. Scientists say the new variant of Covid-19 may have been spotted in the UK first because of the strength of the country's surveillance system. The new variant is considerably more transmissible than previous strains but not necessarily any more dangerous for those infected, experts say. How far has the new variant spread? Those infected in Canada are a couple from Durham, near Toronto, who are now self-isolating. In Japan, the two new cases are a pilot in his 30s who returned to Japan from London on 16 December and a woman in her 20s, one of his family members with no history of visiting the country, Kyodo News reports. Under the travel suspension coming in on Monday, Japanese nationals and non-Japanese residents who are abroad will be allowed to return, and some travellers such as businesspeople will be allowed to enter from a small number of mainly Asian countries. In Spain, four cases of the new variant were confirmed in Madrid. None of the patients, all of whom travelled from the UK, were seriously ill. Switzerland identified three cases, two of which are known to be British citizens currently in the country. Switzerland is alone in Europe in keeping its ski slopes open to tourism over the Christmas and New Year period, and thousands of tourists from Britain have arrived in the last couple of weeks. In Sweden, the health agency said a traveller there was ill with the strain but had been self-isolating since he returned from the UK. France confirmed its first case of the new variant - a French citizen in the central town of Tours who had arrived from London on 19 December, the health ministry said. The man, who had been living in the UK, was asymptomatic and currently self-isolating at home, the ministry said. France closed its border with the UK after the new variant was confirmed in Britain but ended its ban for EU citizens on Wednesday, providing people tested negative before travelling. Thousands of lorry drivers spent Christmas Day in their cabs in Kent waiting to cross the English Channel. Cases in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Australia were reported earlier. What is the new variant? The new variant first detected in southern England in September is blamed for sharp rises in levels of positive tests in recent weeks in London, south-east England and the east of England About two-thirds of people testing positive in these areas could have the new variant - but this is only an estimate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says. Three things are coming together that mean the new variant is attracting attention: - It is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus - It has mutations that affect part of the virus likely to be important - Some of those mutations have already been shown in the lab to increase the ability of the virus to infect cells All of these build a case for a virus that can spread more easily, says the BBC's health and science correspondent, James Gallagher. Experts say the leading vaccines developed in recent months should still work. - LATEST GLOBAL SPREAD: Where has been hit hardest? - VACCINE SAFETY: Will pregnant women receive the Covid-19 vaccine? - IMMUNITY: Does getting coronavirus make you immune? - REALITY CHECK: A vaccine will not alter your DNA"}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "After throwing the bill into doubt earlier this week, President Donald Trump caved Sunday night and signed the coronavirus relief and federal spending measure, averting a government shutdown and ensuring millions of unemployed Americans get some relief going into the new year. It was an act of mercy for millions, after the president suddenly indicated Tuesday night that he wouldn’t support the bill. Trump said he wanted to increase direct stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 ― as well as eliminate a number of foreign aid provisions that were included in his own budget request earlier this year ― but Republicans wouldn’t go along with his call to increase checks, and Trump seemed to realize that holding out on the bill would cause chaos and distress across the country. On top of ending unemployment benefits for more than 10 million people, Trump would have caused a government shutdown, delayed vaccine distribution, and held up stimulus checks for weeks ― if they ever even came. Instead, Trump folded and agreed to the bill that lawmakers and his own administration negotiated. An hour before signing the bill, Trump tweeted from his Mar-a-Lago resort that he had “good news on Covid Relief Bill.” He is vacationing at the Florida resort for the Christmas holiday. Trump’s decision to sign the bill is a major sigh of relief for Republican lawmakers, who were surprised to see the president, who spent months seemingly uninterested in negotiations, suddenly turn on a bill that’s been tediously hashed out for months. Trump released a ranting four-minute video on Twitter Tuesday, where he called the government spending Congress had passed “wasteful” and criticized the COVID-19 provisions as inadequate. He also demanded $2,000 stimulus checks, even though he hadn’t pushed for them in a package his own White House negotiated. The bill, which was largely seen as the only compromise that could get through a deeply divided Congress, passed with veto-proof majorities — 359-53 in the House and 92-6 in the Senate. “The Senate will start the process for a vote that increases checks to $2,000, repeals Section 230, and starts an investigation into voter fraud,” Trump said in a statement after signing the bill. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act shields social media companies from being liable for their users’ behavior. But Trump’s sudden turn against the legislation threatened to sink it entirely. Because the congressional session ends on January 3rd, Trump could have waited to veto the bill and seen the measure die then, forcing both chambers to pass the bill again to send it to his desk, at which point he could have waited another 10 days before deciding to either veto it or let it become law without his signature. Such a decision would have caused another government shutdown ― absent a stopgap spending bill ― and withheld aid from tens of millions of struggling Americans who have lost their jobs or have seen reduced income due to the coronavirus pandemic. The federal programs Congress created to help the jobless earlier this year expired on Dec. 26, cutting off much needed financial help to upward of 14 million Americans who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. In fact, because Trump waited to sign the bill until Sunday night, millions won’t receive benefits this week. According to Michele Evermore, an unemployment policy expert with the National Employment Law Project, unemployment recipients will miss out on one week of the extra $300, already bringing the 11 weeks of extra federal unemployment benefits provided by the legislation down to 10. Congress could still try to pass extra stimulus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) already attempted to increase direct payments in the COVID-19 relief bill from $600 to $2,000 — as Trump demanded — on Christmas Eve, but Republicans blocked the attempt. In the end, Trump signed what Congress gave him in the first place. “As President, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child,” Trump said in the statement. “I will sign the Omnibus and Covid package with a strong message that makes clear to Congress that wasteful items need to be removed,” he continued. “I will send back to Congress a redlined version, item by item, accompanied by the formal rescission request to Congress insisting that those funds be removed from the bill.” Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.) released a statement about Trump wanting to “reverse funding his own administration requested and undo the careful bipartisan agreement he has just signed.” “The House Appropriations Committee has jurisdiction over rescissions, and our Democratic Majority will reject any rescissions submitted by President Trump,” said Lowey, who chairs the committee. Pelosi said in a statement Sunday night that the COVID-19 relief package is “a down payment on what is needed to crush the virus.” “We need to ensure robust support for state and local government to distribute and administer a vaccine, keep workers employed and prevent devastating service cuts — and we must do so as soon as possible,” she said. The law will provide $300 a week in unemployment insurance until mid-March, and a $600 direct payment to those making under $75,000. The law also includes $20 billion for vaccine procurement, and $9 billion for vaccine distribution. K-12 schools, colleges and universities will get $82 billion to deal with pandemic. Small businesses get the most funding; the Paycheck Protection Program will get $284 billion more for forgivable loans to businesses, and there’s an additional $20 billion in Economic Injury Disaster Loans, $15 billion for live entertainment venues and movie theaters, and several billion for other Small Business Administration programs. Federal emergency relief has been a crucial part of keeping Americans afloat as the economy has tanked this year. This law would make people’s lives better by dramatically reversing a persistent decline in personal income caused by the CARES Act programs expiring, according to an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a federal spending watchdog group. CFRB estimates the aid in the COVID-19 relief bill would increase income in the first three months of 2021 between 11 and 13% above pre-pandemic levels. Previous studies have shown the federal programs created under the CARES Act kept millions from sinking into poverty over the summer. “While this boost will not last through the second quarter of next year, higher household savings in the first quarter and a robust economic recovery as the weather warms and vaccines are distributed could make a huge difference for the remainder of 2021,” the CRFB said in its analysis. Trump’s penchant for drama threw Washington in a frenzy this week, completely scrambling political alliances and risking the livelihoods of millions. Suddenly Republicans were forced to defy their own president’s calls for an even bigger relief bill and Democrats were given renewed hope that they could renegotiate parts of the proposal more to their liking. But in the end, Democrats got a different kind of political win. By criticizing the bill before ultimately signing it, Trump has stepped all over the GOP’s message that this bill is a major win for his party — and he’s done it just weeks before two high-stakes Senate races in Georgia on Jan. 5 that will decide control of Congress, where Republican incumbents Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue now have to eat their words touting a law that Trump is on record saying he hates. “Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow,” Pelosi said in her statement. “Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need.” Sanjana Karanth contributed to this report."}

All year, cleaning products have been flying off the shelves — now, they're flying straight into Christmas stockings and wrapping paper. Holiday-season sales of sanitizing wipes and sprays have doubled this year, according to Nielsen. Sales of hand sanitizer have more than quadrupled. \"You can say, 'Oh, yeah, remember back in 2020, when we all had a bottle of scented hand sanitizer in our stockings?' \" says Charles Kopec, a neuroscience researcher from New Jersey who's also gifting his wife's parents a UV-light box to help keep their cellphones a bit cleaner. Whether as a joke or something serious and practical — or both — coronavirus essentials make for no-brainer holiday presents. Fancy soaps and face masks! Bedazzled face shields! Little bottles with hooks for sanitizing on the go! Mary Lopez, a retired forensic accountant from California, is a longtime home-necessities gifting proponent, and her family has been giving pandemic-themed gifts all year. For her daughter's birthday, Lopez assembled a basket of lockdown-survival aids, including Clorox cleaning spray, some money on a gift card, two candy-filled wine glasses and a bottle of wine. Her daughter replicated this basket for her friends for the holidays, adding also toilet paper and jigsaw puzzles. Gifts of sanitation tend to be an add-on to other items people are exchanging this year — a dose of pandemic reality on top of regular gifts. According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, categories selling particularly well are electronics, home furnishings and athleisure clothes. On a recent run to Costco just outside Washington, D.C., banking analyst Ritesh Ranjan spotted a 2020 unicorn: a five pack of Clorox wipes. He remembered friends mentioning they had trouble finding them. \"Hopefully it'll remind them of the conversation we have had about it, and hopefully it helps,\" Ranjan said. But later he felt a bit guilty for snatching those wipes that are so rare these days: \"Did [I] steer the product away from someone who would need it much more urgently?\" he pondered. \"After I bought this one, I decided I'm not going to buy any more of these for gifts.\" Kathleen Murray, a teacher from Virginia Beach, Va., also never expected to be gifting cleaning products for the holidays. But she came across some holiday-themed hand sanitizers, with scents like vanilla and Christmas cookies, and couldn't resist. \"It at least cheers you up,\" she said. \"You have to use it regardless. But if it smells like gingerbread, I'd rather use that.\" The sanitizers went into her Advent calendars for family members, as little daily gifts alongside candy, festive face masks and other pandemic essentials. Asked if all these sanitation-themed gifts felt just a little bit sad, she laughed. \"I guess a bit sad,\" Murray said. \"But also like — if you could give anyone a gift, you want to give them safety. I would love to be able to give them all the vaccine, but you obviously can't do that. It's the closest thing to safety that you can give them.\""}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Trump vetoes $740 billion defense legislation President Trump vetoed the defense spending bill Wednesday, after previously tweeting threats to do just that. Wednesday marked the deadline to veto the National Defense Authorization Act before it became law. The president left the White House for his Christmas getaway at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Trump, who insists he is one of the most pro-military presidents in history, pledged to veto the legislation when it did not include the nixing of Section 230, a provision protecting internet companies from being liable for what third parties post on their platforms. \"No one has worked harder, or approved more money for the military, than I have — over $2 trillion,\" Mr. Trump said as he explained his veto to Congress. \"During my four years, with the support of many others, we have almost entirely rebuilt the United States military, which was totally depleted when I took office. Your failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone knowing what we are doing at every step.\" The House and Senate passed the NDAA with veto-proof majorities, but it remains to be seen whether House Republicans will still stand up to the president when the legislation returns to the House. Both the House and Senate need to re-approve the legislation with two-thirds majorities in order to override a presidential veto. The House and Senate will have to return after Christmas to vote. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on Thursday that the House would return on Monday to overturn Mr. Trump's veto. The $740 billion bill funds the Pentagon, and includes a 3% raise for troops. Opposition to the president's veto, including from Republicans, was immediate. \"The NDAA has become law every year for 59 years straight because it's absolutely vital to our national security and our troops. This year must not be an exception. Our men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform shouldn't be denied what they need— ever,\" said Republican Senator Jim Inhofe from Oklahoma. Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act means internet companies, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, aren't generally liable if a user posts something illegal. Mr. Trump and some Republicans such as Senator Ted Cruz and Senator Josh Hawley have railed against social media companies for how they handle conservative content. But the defense spending bill isn't the only legislation up in the air. Mr. Trump has also threatened to refuse to sign the COVID-19 relief package that is expected at his desk soon, insisting it needs to include stimulus checks for $2,000 and other provisions. Mr. Trump, who declined to directly take part in negotiations and instead sent Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, did not speak publicly about his support for larger stimulus checks during negotiations."}

The president, meanwhile, doubled down on his baseless claims that he won the presidential election in a \"magnificent landslide\" and attacked the two most powerful Republicans in the U.S. Senate because they've acknowledged that President-elect Biden won the election. Trump's broadsides against his own party, unproven election claims and 11th-hour stimulus demands after essentially being absent through the entire negotiating process continued his pattern of sowing chaos in the waning days of his presidency as he's failed to publicly accept that he will be leaving the White House in less than a month. \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said in his Twitter video. \"I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\" Watch: The year-end funding package, often referred to as an omnibus, was combined with the coronavirus stimulus bill as Congress raced to get out of Washington, D.C., for Christmas. The funding package was previously negotiated in Congress, while lawmakers finally came to an agreement on the coronavirus aid over the weekend. Both would have had to pass anyway, but combining them allowed it to be done in one vote. TRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS Some lawmakers had voiced process objections over the fact the two were combined and derisively termed the monstrous legislation the \"coronabus.\" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said it \"should have been divided into well over 20 bills.\" But Trump appeared to confuse the spending package that funds the government and the coronavirus stimulus. \"A few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever,\" Trump said. \"However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.\" Trump added: \"For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity -- it's called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID.\" It's unclear at this point what Congress will do about Trump's demands. Trump did not issue a direct veto threat in his Tuesday video and still could sign the bill if lawmakers and their staffs don't come back -- although it is not clear if they will or not, according to congressional sources. FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS Trump also has the potential, if he simply refuses to sign the \"coronabus\" and Congress doesn't send him anything more, to \"pocket veto\" the legislation. That would force Congress to essentially start the legislative process all over. It would put the government at risk of a shutdown yet again, as it is currently operating on a seven-day interim spending bill. Democrats, meanwhile, immediately seized on Trump's check demand to attack Republicans and demand that the direct stimulus be increased to $2,000 per individual. The House plans on Thursday to try to amend the bill via unanimous consent. \"Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., tweeted. \"At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 — Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let’s do it!\" \"I’m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted. \"Let’s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment on what the Senate may do in light of Trump's Monday video. He and other GOP lawmakers touted the stimulus deal as a triumph on Monday and Tuesday before Trump called it a \"disgrace.\" The White House also did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story. PRESIDENT TRUMP GRANTS SEVERAL HIGH-PROFILE PARDONS And the pressure on Republicans is not just from a legislative angle in Congress. Trump handed the Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia a cudgel with which to hammer their incumbent Republican opponents. \"Last night Kelly Loeffler and I left Georgia late, got up there just before midnight, we voted on this next round of COVID relief and I'm so proud to be able to bring that relief back to Georgia,\" Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a video posted Tuesday, hours before Trump slammed lawmakers for sending the package to his desk. Ammar Moussa, a spokesman for Jon Ossoff, who is the Democrat challenging Perdue, shared Trump's video with his followers. \"David Perdue is already running ads touting a COVID relief bill he had nothing to do with,\" Moussa said. \"Here’s Donald Trump ripping it apart.\" \"President Trump is as ever, erratic and all over the place, but on this point, he's right. $600 is a joke,\" Ossoff himself added. \"And David Perdue, my opponent, who opposed even the first round of $1,200 checks – imagine that... And now decided he wanted to cut it down to $600 bucks when people can barely feed their families through no fault of their own.\" Many Republicans were already worried that Trump's election fraud claims could depress GOP turnout for Loeffler and Perdue, although Trump has vocally backed the two senators and even traveled to Georgia to campaign for them. The campaigns for Perdue and Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., did not respond to requests for comment on the Trump video. The Georgia Senate races will decide which party controls the body for the next two years and to what extent Republicans can thwart Biden's agenda. In a separate video Tuesday, Trump continued his false claims that \"we won the election by a landslide, we won it big.\" He repeated a number of claims that have been pushed by fringe allies of his, including lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, whose election-related lawsuits have been uniformly rejected by the courts. Trump concluded, \"We cannot allow a completely fraudulent election to stand.\" Trump's allegations of voter fraud have been putting Republicans in a tight spot, forcing them to choose between supporting the president's unsubstantiated claims or risking his Twitter ire. And no Republicans are immune from it. In the past week, Trump has lambasted the top two Republicans in the Senate for accepting the result of the presidential election -- that Biden won. After McConnell congratulated Biden on his victory, Trump last week said in a tweet that McConnell \"and Republican Senators have to get tougher.\" Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., meanwhile, previously said that \"it's time for everybody to move on\" from the election challenges and to accept Biden's victory. Asked Monday about the prospects for success of a challenge in Congress to Biden's Electoral College victory, which Trump has endorsed, Thune said it will be \"going down like a shot dog.\" That led Trump to declare that Thune's time in the Senate is limited. \"Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget. Right now they would be down 8 seats without my backing them in the last Election. RINO John Thune, 'Mitch’s boy', should just let it play out,\" Trump said in a tweet Tuesday. \"South Dakota doesn’t like weakness. He will be primaried in 2022, political career over!!!\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thune's office has not publicly responded to the Trump tweet. Trump will leave office on Jan. 20 when Biden is inaugurated, at least somewhat easing the pressure on the GOP to back his erratic behavior. But he has already hinted that he would run for president in 2024, which could freeze the field of presidential candidates and force Republicans to continue to be accountable to Trump or else risk losing his base. Fox News reported Tuesday that Bill Stepien, Trump's reelection campaign manager, and other top Trump campaign members are setting up a political consulting firm that will likely work with Trump as he continues to wield his influence over the GOP even after he leaves office. Fox News' Jason Donner, Chad Pergram and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report."}

The United States is the first country to greenlight use of Moderna's vaccine, which was developed in part with the National Institutes of Health. Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \"This is another crucial step in the fight against the global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States every day,\" FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said during a media briefing late Friday. Indeed, the news was met with optimism. \"I've never been more hopeful that we will eventually turn the corner on this pandemic,\" said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and current president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"I encourage all Americans to get vaccinated when their groups are called, and I look forward to doing so when it is my turn.\" Nearly 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine have been earmarked for distribution and are expected to be shipped to 3,285 locations across the country, according to officials with Operation Warp Speed, which partially funded the Moderna work. In a statement issued Friday, Moderna said that about 20 million doses of its vaccine will be delivered to the U.S. government by the end of this year. \"The Company expects to have between 100 million and 125 million doses available globally in the first quarter of 2021, with 85-100 million of those available in the U.S.,\" the statement read. Moderna's vaccine has been shown to be safe and highly effective at preventing symptomatic illness, according to documents released Tuesday. The data also suggest that the vaccine may reduce the virus's spread by preventing infections, though more data are needed to fully understand that finding. Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, called the finding \"intriguing\" during the Friday briefing, adding that the NIH is considering studying this further. The FDA authorization comes the day after an advisory committee to the agency recommended the vaccine in a near unanimous vote. Of 21 voting members, 20 voted in favor of authorization. One person, Dr. Michael Kurilla, an infectious disease expert with the National Institutes of Health, abstained from voting because he said he felt the question on which the committee voted, \"Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?\" was too broad, and should have been targeted toward people at highest risk for severe Covid-19. Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Last week, the FDA authorized Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine for those ages 16 and older. Nearly 3 million doses of that vaccine were on target for delivery this week to health care workers and people in long-term care facilities. A second batch of doses has been reserved for the second shot, administered 21 days after the first. Moderna's vaccine is also given in two doses, but 28 days apart. Clinical trials showed the vaccine was 94 percent effective in preventing symptomatic illness within two weeks after the second dose. Pfizer's has been shown to be similarly effective. Unlike the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine does not need to be stored at ultracold temperatures. Rather, the vaccine can be stored at 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperature of a standard refrigerator — for up to 30 days, the company said in a statement Wednesday. One potentially thorny issue is the risk of severe allergic reactions. The FDA's Marks said Friday night that the agency was looking into \"roughly five\" allergic reactions linked to the Pfizer vaccine. One of those reactions was reported in a health care worker in Alaska who needed to be hospitalized. While no such reactions were reported during Moderna's clinical trials, the FDA is advising people who have had severe reactions to vaccines in the past to forgo the vaccine at this time, until more information is available. One potential — but as yet unproven — culprit for the allergic reactions is polyethylene glycol, which is present in both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Marks said, adding any ideas about what could be leading to allergic reactions remain speculative. No long-term problems have been reported. Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook."}
