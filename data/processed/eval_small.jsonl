Economists had forecast 4.25 million new claims for this week. The previous week’s claims figure was revised down 2,000 to 5,506,500. Continuing claims, those made after an initial week of benefits, rose to 15.98 million. Continuing claims, however, are reported with a one week lag. The total number of Americans who have lost their jobs since claims spiked five weeks ago because of coronavirus and shutdowns rose to around 26.4 million, enough to erase all the job gains since the economy began to recover after the financial crisis. The 4-week moving average was 5,786,500, an increase of 280,000 from the previous week’s revised average. The CARES Act, passed to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders, expanded the ranks of those eligible to file claims for unemployment benefits and raised the amount paid to unemployed workers. Self-employed workers and independent contractors can now file for benefits, expanding the number of claims. New claims for state unemployment benefits are a proxy for layoffs. Released weekly, they are some of the few real-time indicators of economic conditions. Actual job losses may be higher than the most recent figures reveal. Applications in many states have been hampered by websites and phone lines failing due to the rapid rise in the volume of claims. Employers are slashing their payrolls to try to stay afloat because their revenue has collapsed, especially at restaurants, hotels, gyms, movie theaters, and other venues that depend on face-to-face interaction. Auto sales have sunk, non-healthcare related manufacturing has ground to a halt, and factories have closed. More than 90 percent of the U.S. population is now under stay-at-home orders, which have been imposed by most U.S. states. This trend has intensified pressure on businesses, most of which face rent, loans, and other bills that must be paid. The CARES Act included hundreds of billions of dollars for loans for businesses that can be forgiven if borrowers keep workers on their payrolls. That could be holding down the levels of layoffs despite the shutdowns. The biggest spike in claims was in Florida, where the Labor Department estimated claims rose by 324,718 to 505,137. That estimate may include those who lost their jobs earlier but were not counted due to problems getting on the unemployment rolls thanks to outdated technology overwhelmed by the surge in claims."}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Which four Republicans will be on stage for the fourth presidential debate? Just four Republicans will be on stage Wednesday for the fourth Republican presidential debate at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, the Republican National Committee announced Monday evening. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Former Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy are the four who met the qualifications, the smallest field yet to take the stage during the GOP primary campaign. The threshold set by the RNC was the highest set so far, demanding candidates reach at least 6% support in two national polls or 6% in one national poll as well as two polls from four of the early-voting states — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The RNC approved the polls that would qualify candidates. And candidates also needed a minimum of 80,000 unique donors, with at least 200 from 20 states or territories. And participants also had to sign a pledge promising to support the party's eventual nominee. Here's where the candidates stand: Ron DeSantis' campaign and the super PAC supporting him have made substantial investments in Iowa, but he has faced some setbacks. In the hours after DeSantis wrapped up his tour of all 99 counties in Iowa on Saturday, news broke of further shakeups at the super PAC supporting him, \"Never Back Down.\" Kristin Davison, who was named to be the PAC's CEO shortly after Chris Jankowski left the job in late November, was fired Saturday. Communications director Erin Perrine and operations director Matt Palmisano were also let go that evening, according to sources familiar with the moves. Politico, Semafor and the Associated Press were first to report on the three moves. Despite his efforts, DeSantis continues to trail front runner and former President Donald Trump by double digits, and former Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley has been closing in on DeSantis with strong performances in previous debates and a shift toward foreign policy that plays to her strength in that area. Ramaswamy, the youngest candidate in the field and a political neophyte, has had fiery debate-night clashes with Haley, and there could be more Wednesday night. During the last debate, Haley called the entrepreneur \"scum\" after he invoked Haley's daughter during a critique of TikTok. The 2024 race's most vocal critic of Trump, Christie has cast himself as the only Republican willing to take him on directly. Without Trump at the debates, Christie has been left without his intended target but has brought him up nonetheless. In September, Christie looked directly into the camera and declared that if Trump keeps skipping debates, he would deserve a new nickname: \"Donald Duck.\" On CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" with moderator Margaret Brennan Sunday, Christie dismissed polls that show Trump far ahead of the field, despite the lawsuits and indictments in which he's embroiled. \"Let's remember something, in this — in the Republican primary in '07, do you know who was winning at this time in '07? Mitt Romney,\" he told Brennan. \"You know who was winning at this time in '11? Newt Gingrich. And winning this time and '15 was Ben Carson. I don't remember any of those presidencies, Margaret. So, you know, my view, we can't worry about that kind of stuff.\" Still, Trump is skipping his fourth straight debate. Instead of going to Alabama he's holding a closed-door campaign fundraiser in Florida. He has said he's forgoing the primary debates because he does not want to elevate his lower-polling opponents by being onstage with them. He and his campaign have also called on the RNC to cancel the remainder of the debates and instead focus on backing him against President Joe Biden. Though Sen. Tim Scott participated in the third debate, he dropped his presidential bid soon afterward, saying that voters \"have been really clear that they're telling me, 'Not now, Tim.'\" On Monday, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum — who didn't qualify for the third debate and wasn't on track for the fourth — suspended his campaign, condemning \"the RNC's clubhouse debate requirements\" that he argued \"are nationalizing the primary process.\" He suggested recently that if he had known about the RNC's debate thresholds before announcing his campaign, he might not have run for president. \"The amount of resources to run a national effort is very different than the resources to run in state,\" Burgum said last week on a New Hampshire radio show. \"And also, you've got a limited amount of time, as well,\" noting he only entered the race in June."}

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "The European Union has agreed to an embargo on most Russian oil imports after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement”, after tweeting on Monday night that sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports, “cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine”. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said the ban “will effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year” because Germany and Poland had committed to renounce deliveries via a pipeline to their territory. Michel added that the package also included removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”. Von der Leyen called the agreement on a sixth sanctions package was “an important step forward” and said the bloc had agreed a “massive investment in renewable energy” in order to compensate for the diversifying away from Russian oil. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, later tweeted: “A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.” Volodymyr Zelenskiy had earlier appealed to EU leaders to show unity against Vladimir Putin. At a summit in Brussels, EU leaders had been attempting to find a way to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Putin’s war machine. Under a compromise plan that was discussed at the summit, Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia would be exempt from the EU embargo. In a press conference on Monday night, Michel acknowledged talk of a lack of European unity, adding: “I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.” Michel said the European Council and G7 was also ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid its post-war reconstruction and immediate liquidity needs. However, von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”. The EU had stalled over its latest sanctions against Russia for nearly four weeks since the Von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil by the end of the year. Arriving at the summit, Orbán said “the pipeline solution is not bad” but insisted his country needed guarantees it could get oil from other sources if there was an “accident” at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. In typically pugnacious style, Orbán attacked the commission for what he called its “irresponsible behaviour” and blamed it for creating a “difficult situation”. The bloc has come under increasing criticism for slow progress in agreeing the latest sanctions package, the sixth, including from Zelenskiy, who addressed the gathering on Monday by video link. Ukraine’s president called on leaders to end their disputes, which “only encourage Russia to put more pressure on you”, according to an extract of his speech published on Telegram. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said earlier he was confident there was a “good solution” on the oil embargo. Germany, along with Poland, has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Officials close to the talks say the decision of these two large economies to forgo oil from the northern leg of the Druzhba pipeline means the EU oil embargo would cover 93% of Russian oil supply by the end of the year. As yet there is no end date on the exemption for the southern leg of Druzhba, covering Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, landlocked countries that are heavily dependent on Russian oil. Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said he intended to warn his fellow leaders not to get “bogged down” in details. “The big picture is that we have to starve Russia, Moscow, of the funds to continue the war,” he said. “If each European country only thinks about itself then we will never move forward.” Italy, the Baltic states, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries that import oil on tankers had initial reservations about an exemption for pipeline oil that would give an advantage to those countries that can continue to import cheaper Russian oil. But there was growing willingness to accept an imbalance on the EU’s internal market to secure agreement on sanctions. Beyond sanctions, EU leaders are expected to approve €9bn in emergency support for Ukraine, although there is no decision yet on whether the funds will be low-interest loans or non-repayable grants. Ukraine will need hundreds of billions to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals, residential buildings and infrastructure. The European Commission has proposed a jointly managed reconstruction body to be organised by Ukraine and the EU, with contributions from international institutions. As EU talks went on, it emerged Russia would cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. The Dutch-backed trader GasTerra revealed the move after the company refused to meet the Kremlin’s demand of paying Gazprom in roubles. About 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia. Some EU leaders are already talking about a seventh round of Russia sanctions targeting gas. But some argue the EU rushed too quickly into an oil embargo. “We talked about oil, under pressure from [the] Baltics and Poland before having done our homework,” a senior EU diplomat said. “Under the pressure of this war we have maybe taken some steps too soon and we are now facing the consequences.” Additional reporting by Pjotr Sauer"}

Fiorina has lost 11 points in the last month, declining from 15% support and second place to 4% and a tie for seventh place. At the same time, Carson has gained eight points and joins Trump as the only two candidates with support above 20%. As in early September before Fiorina’s spike in support, Trump and Carson are the first choice candidate of about half of the potential Republican electorate. All told, nearly two-thirds of Republican voters choose Trump or Carson as either their first or second choice for the nomination. No other candidates made significant gains since the last CNN/ORC poll conducted just after the Republican debate hosted by CNN and the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The complete CNN/ORC poll results Overall, Trump’s 27% leads the field, followed by Carson at 22%, both head and shoulders above their nearest competition. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are tied for third place with 8% support each, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul each at 5%. Fiorina, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz each have 4% support, while Ohio Gov. John Kasich is at 3%. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum stands at 2% and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham holds 1%. The new poll comes amid a flurry of polling being released about a week before the GOP candidates will again meet on the debate stage. The polling criteria set by the organizers of that debate, set to take place October 28, appear likely to result in 10 candidates taking the main stage. Aside from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who ended his campaign shortly after last month’s debate, it’s likely to be a rematch of those who debated in Simi Valley. Fiorina’s decline comes across the demographic and political spectrum, with her support now topping out at 8% among those with college degrees. Last month, she stood at 22% among the same group. Fiorina has dropped 11 points among women and 12 points among men, fallen 18 points among independents, 17 points among those age 50 or older, and 15 points among conservatives. The poll finds Republican voters increasingly satisfied with their field of choices, 32% say they are “very satisfied” with the group of candidates running for president, up from 23% in July. Republicans also remain more enthusiastic about the presidential race than Democratic voters. In the new poll, 68% of Republican voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president in next year’s election, compared with 58% among Democratic voters. Trump/Carson 2016? ‘Stranger things have happened’ Those enthusiastic voters are even more strongly behind Trump and Carson than Republican voters generally, while less enthusiastic Republicans are more likely to say they back Bush. Trump’s support among the enthusiastic voters is 30%, with Carson at 25%, while Bush’s support dips to just 3%. Among those who say they are “somewhat enthusiastic” or less, 22% back Trump, 16% back Carson and 15% back Bush. There are some signs in the poll that Carson’s numbers get a boost if turnout in GOP primaries and caucuses follows the same patterns it has in the past. Carson runs about evenly with Trump among the groups that make up the largest blocs of GOP primary voters: conservatives, self-identified Republicans and white evangelicals. Carson also nearly matches Trump’s support among those voters with college degrees, with 24% backing Trump, 23% backing Carson and 13% backing Rubio. A gender gap has reemerged in the data in the last month, with Carson matching Trump’s support among women (23% back each) with Bush behind at 9%, Huckabee at 7% and Fiorina and Rubio each at 6% among GOP women. Trump has larger edges over Carson among men (31% to 21%, with Rubio at 10%) and independents who lean toward the Republican Party (32% Trump to 19% Carson). Trump backtracks Afghanistan War comments: Not a mistake The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adults. Results among the 465 registered voters who say they are Republicans or independents who lean toward the Republican Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points."}

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said there will be riots on the streets if former President Donald Trump faces charges over his handling of documents. He made the explosive prediction during an appearance on Fox News’s Sunday Night in America in an interview with host and former Rep. Trey Gowdy, arguing there is “no law” and a “double standard” when it comes to Trump and compared the situation to the controversy over Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server while serving as secretary of state. TOP HOUSE INTELLIGENCE REPUBLICAN WANTS PROOF OF TRUMP DECLASSIFICATION ORDER “If there is a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling the classified information after the Clinton debacle, which you presided over and did [a] hell of a good job, there will be riots in the streets,” Graham said to Gowdy, who was a leading GOP investigator of Clinton when he was in Congress. The senator repeated the same line at the end of the interview after being asked about the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, seeking his testimony in a Trump-focused investigation over the 2020 election, adding, “I worry about our country.” Graham and Gowdy also discussed the treatment of stories about Hunter Biden in the run-up to the 2020 election and whistleblower allegations, including those claiming the FBI slow-walked its investigation into his laptop. Clinton was criticized in the heat of the 2016 presidential election by then-FBI director James Comey, who called her handling of classified information “extremely careless,” but she was not prosecuted for her use of the private email server. Allies of Trump have made comparisons to the Clinton matter particularly after the FBI conducted a search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida earlier this month, escalating what has been revealed to be a monthslong back and forth in which the federal government has sought to recover documents, including some that have been deemed classified. An unsealed warrant showed the former president is being investigated for possible violations of the Espionage Act and obstruction of justice. An underlying affidavit, which featured many redactions, noted the “government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records.” It added that there is “probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found.” Trump claimed he declassified all the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago and denied any wrongdoing. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “The DOJ and FBI are practicing Election Interference at the highest and most dishonest level our Country has ever seen before, both in the Midterms, and the 2024 Presidential Election,” he said on Truth Social on Sunday. Trump declared that he declassified documents from the Crossfire Hurricane investigation just before he left office, but it’s unclear whether those records are part of the eclectic array of items found at Mar-a-Lago. His legal team seeks a special master to review the documents seized from his residence. A federal judge in Florida announced the court’s “preliminary intent to appoint a special master” to review the documents, per a filing on Saturday."}

In a conversation with Israeli Defense Secretary Yoav Gallant, \"Secretary Austin reiterated the United States' commitment to take every possible step to defend Israel and noted the strengthening of U.S. military force posture and capabilities throughout the Middle East,\" a Pentagon readout of the conversation said. The two defense officials \"also discussed Israel's operations in Gaza and the importance of mitigating civilian harm, progress towards securing a cease-fire and the release of hostages held in Gaza\" as well as efforts to deter Iran, Hezbollah, and other Iran-allied groups in the region. U.S. officials told CBS News on Monday that a limited attack from both Hezbollah and Iran could come with little to no warning. Hezbollah has been and remains positioned to launch attacks with virtually no warning, and Iran has made enough preparations to launch a limited attack with little warning, possibly coordinated to align with a Hezbollah launch, the officials said. On Monday, the leaders of the U.K., Germany and France released their own joint statement calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, the release of the hostages and the \"unfettered\" delivery of aid to Gaza. They urged Iran and its proxies, like Lebanon's Hezbollah, to refrain from attacks that could further escalate the conflict in the region. \"They will bear responsibility for actions that jeopardize this opportunity for peace and stability,\" the joint statement said. \"No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East.\" Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, announced Monday that a further 142 people had been killed in Israeli strikes over the past 48 hours, bringing the Palestinian death toll in Gaza since the war began to 39,897 people. Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking 250 people hostage. Around 110 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza and Israeli authorities believe around a third of the remaining hostages are no longer alive. On Saturday, in one of the deadliest attacks in Gaza since the start of the war, an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City killed at least 80 people, according to The Associated Press. Israel's military said it struck a Hamas command center located inside a mosque on the Al-Taba'een school grounds and that it used \"three precise munitions which, according to professional analysis, cannot cause the amount of damage that is being reported by the Hamas-run Government Information Office in Gaza.\" In a statement, Hamas said those in the compound were displaced people seeking shelter and they were killed while performing their dawn prayers. \"They are liars, liars, liars,\" one woman said of the IDF. \"There were no fighters.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Biden slams Trump for Capitol riot in 2024 campaign speech In his first campaign speech of 2024, President Joe Biden cast his likely election opponent, Donald Trump, as a fundamental threat to American democracy. \"Whether democracy is still America's sacred cause is the most urgent question of our time,\" Mr Biden said. \"It's what the 2024 election is all about,\" he added. Mr Trump labelled the speech \"pathetic fear mongering\" and called Mr Biden the threat to democracy. \"Biden's record is an unbroken streak of weakness, incompetence, corruption and failure,\" said the former president at a rally in the state of Iowa. Mr Biden's speech saw him returning to a theme he has invoked over and over in recent years. This time, he explicitly drew a line to the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol to make his case. That day, Mr Trump's supporters violently stormed Congress to stop lawmakers from certifying the presidential election results for Mr Biden, just weeks before he was set to take office. Mr Trump, the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, frequently repeats the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The former president has also attempted to reframe the 6 January attack as a \"beautiful day.\" He has referred to the individuals who participated as \"patriots\" and political prisoners, and vowed to pardon them if he returns to the White House. Taking direct aim at this rhetoric, Mr Biden accused Mr Trump of trying to \"steal history\", attacking his rival by name repeatedly. \"Trump's mob wasn't a peaceful protest, it was a violent assault,\" Mr Biden said. \"They were insurrectionists, not patriots. They were not there to uphold the Constitution, they were there to destroy the Constitution.\" \"He calls those who oppose him vermin. He talks about the blood of Americans being poisoned, echoing the same exact language used in Nazi Germany,\" Mr Biden said. The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jason Miller, a senior Trump campaign adviser, wrote on X that Mr Biden \"has given up on running an issues-based campaign for 2024\". \"Rather than help those suffering from Bidenomics or our porous southern border, Biden plans on weaponising government against his leading political opponent,\" Mr Miller wrote. Mr Biden has returned to the theme of preserving democracy again and again. In 2020, he campaigned as the candidate capable of restoring America to normalcy. Before the 2022 midterms, Mr Biden described that election as a \"battle for the soul of this nation\". On Friday the venue in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, a key site in the American Revolutionary War, was chosen to underscore the themes of Mr Biden's address. Even the music contributed to the atmosphere: as Mr Biden strode to the podium, a song from Hamilton, a musical about the Founding Fathers, played over the loudspeakers. After a year of failing to improve Mr Biden's standing in the polls by highlighting his economic agenda, his re-election campaign has re-focused on democracy, highlighting the stark differences between him and Mr Trump. The strategy has been effective for Mr Biden before. Democrats exceeded expectations in the 2022 midterms by hammering controversial, pro-Trump Republican opponents who questioned the legitimacy of US elections. The issue \"has incredible resonance with the Democratic base,\" said Ashley Etienne, a former Biden 2020 senior campaign adviser. \"There's nothing more foundational to who we are than democracy,\" Ms Etienne said. \"But it is a winning strategy. It's a winning message. And it's facilitated this incredibly broad coalition of voters.\" Mr Biden's Democratic allies seemed pleased with his decision to focus on democratic values. \"I'm glad to see the president going on the offence today to talk about democracy, to talk about freedom, and to talk about the fact that Trump puts all of that at risk,\" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, told reporters. Recent polling has shown that three years later, Americans' views of the 6 January attack are starkly divided along partisan lines, with Republicans now less likely to believe it was a violent attack. About a quarter of Americans believe a conspiracy theory that the FBI, not Mr Trump's supporters, instigated the riot, a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found."}

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in a statement Tuesday that the bank was also ordered to pay an additional $90 million in penalties to the CFPB and $60 million in penalties to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The CFPB specifically accused the bank of harming \"hundreds of thousands of consumers over a period of several years\" for, in part, \"systematically double-dipping on fees imposed on customers with insufficient funds in their account,\" which the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said was illegal. CFPB CRACKS DOWN ON OVERDRAFT, BOUNCED CHECK FEES Historically, the bank would charge customers a $35 overdraft fee after the bank declined a transaction because there were insufficient funds in the account. However, the CFPB accused the bank of \"allowing fees to be repeatedly charged for the same transaction.\" The agency said Bank of America \"generated substantial additional revenue by illegally charging multiple $35 fees.\" Bank of America said it has not been charging the extra fee for the past 18 months. In 2022, the bank eliminated every fee except the overdraft fee, which was reduced from $35 to $10. EXPERTS SAY CFPB CUTTING OVERDRAFT FEES COULD HURT CONSUMERS \"We voluntarily reduced overdraft fees and eliminated all non-sufficient fund fees in the first half of 2022,\" a Bank of America spokesperson told FOX Business.

The CFPB also accused the bank of illegally withholding \"promised credit card account bonuses, such as cash rewards or bonus points to tens of thousands of consumers\" who submitted applications over the phone or in person. Regulators also accused the bank of denying \"sign-up bonuses to consumers due to the failure of Bank of America’s business processes and systems.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Bank of America employees are also accused of illegally applying \"for and enrolled consumers in credit card accounts without consumers’ knowledge or authorization,\" since at least 2012, according to the CFPB. In order to do this, the bank illegally used consumers’ credit reports, without their permission, to complete applications, the CFPB said. As a result, \"consumers were charged unjustified fees, suffered negative effects to their credit profiles, and had to spend time correcting errors,\" the CFPB said. Bank of America serves 68 million people and small business clients."}

Neal told IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig that if he does not respond to his letter, Neal will interpret that as denying the request, setting the stage for a potential court battle. The Treasury Department missed an April 10 deadline last week set by Democrats to deliver the tax returns, and Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the department hadn’t decided whether to comply with the request. “It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury, or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the Committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns or return information,” Neal wrote. The letter marks the latest in a yearslong effort by Democrats to get access to Trump’s financial documents. Neal asked for Trump’s personal and business returns from 2013-18. Democrats say it is within their mandate of congressional oversight, but the unprecedented move has been opposed by Republicans. AOC REMINDS TRUMP IN TWEET ABOUT TAX RETURN REQUEST: 'WE DIDN'T ASK YOU' Trump has said repeatedly throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and his presidency that he can’t make public his tax returns because he is under audit. A lawyer for Trump said in a letter last week that the efforts are an attempt to harass a political opponent and that it would set a “dangerous precedent” for the agency to turn them over. “For good reason, it would be a gross abuse of power for the majority to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation,” William S. Consovoy said in a letter to the Treasury’s general counsel. In his letter, Consovoy said that Neal “cannot legally request” the information as the tax code guards taxpayer privacy with the exception of certain conditions -- which he says are not met. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP “Even if Ways and Means had a legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President’s tax returns and return information, that purpose is not driving Chairman Neal’s request,” he wrote. “His request is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics and speech,” he added.

According to three sources speaking with Axios, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will announce sanctions against the IDF’s 97th Netzah Yehuda Battalion. Notably, the sanctions are not due to any actions during the war in Gaza, but rather human rights abuses committed in the West Bank before Oct. 7, 2023. The battalion is made up of ultra-Orthodox Jews with an emphasis on accommodating their religious practices. Following the low enlistment rates among ultra-Orthodox Jews, the battalion recently began to accept far-right youth who were rejected from other combat units. It has not been involved in active combat operations in Gaza. Among the human rights abuses cited was its involvement in the death of elderly Palestinian American Omar Assad, who died after he was handcuffed, gagged, and forced to lie on his stomach for an extended period. Israel launched an investigation into the incident but decided against pursuing criminal charges against anyone involved, choosing only to “reprimand” one of the commanders. The sanctions against the unit will prohibit it from receiving any U.S. military aid, participating in activities receiving American funding, and taking part in training with the U.S. military. Several other units were investigated by the U.S. for abuses but cleared after remedying the behavior. The sanctions against the Netzah Yehuda Battalion will be removed if they are seen to have taken credible moves to remedy the problem as well. The unit was moved from the West Bank to the Golan Heights after reports of widespread abuses against other Palestinian civilians. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER Though this is the first instance of the U.S. sanctioning an IDF military unit, it is not the first sanctioning of Israelis. The Biden administration previously sanctioned Israeli settlers for attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The Biden administration has sought to balance its own support for Israel with the concerns of progressive voters, who allege Israel is committing genocide in the Gaza Strip. So far, they have been outraged at Biden’s handling of the war, and many are threatening to withhold their votes in November if changes are not made."}

The pointed remarks came as Vance visited U.S. troops on Pituffik Space Base on the mineral-rich, strategically critical island alongside his wife and other senior U.S. officials for a trip that was ultimately scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were not consulted about the original itinerary. “Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,” Vance said. “You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change.” Vance said the U.S. has “no option” but to take a significant position to ensure the security of Greenland as he encouraged a push in Greenland for independence from Denmark. “I think that they ultimately will partner with the United States,” Vance said. “We could make them much more secure. We could do a lot more protection. And I think they’d fare a lot better economically as well.” The reaction by members of Greenland’s parliament and residents has rendered that unlikely, with anger erupting over the Trump administration’s attempts to annex the vast Arctic island. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on Vance’s claim that Denmark isn’t doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country “a good and strong ally.” Soon after arriving, Vance briefly addressed U.S. troops stationed at the base as he and his wife sat down to lunch with them, saying that the Trump administration is very interested in “Arctic security.” He and his entourage, including national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, later received briefings from military officials. It was minus-3 degrees F (minus-19 degrees C) when the delegation landed at the remote base 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) north of the Arctic Circle. “It’s cold as s—- here. Nobody told me,” Vance said, prompting laughs. The revised trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes as relations between the U.S. and the Nordic country, a traditional U.S. ally and NATO member, have soured. Trump had repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the island. During his remarks at the end of the brief visit, Vance underscored that he did not think military force was ever going to be necessary as he pressed the idea of a dramatically enhanced American position on the island. “Because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we’re going to have to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America,” Vance said while adding that the people of Greenland had the right to determine their own future. In Washington, Trump on Friday said the U.S. “needs Greenland for international security.” Trump, speaking to reporters soon after Vance’s arrival, alluded to the rising Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, where sea lanes have opened up because of climate change. “Greenland’s very important for the peace of the world,” Trump said. “And I think Denmark understands, and I think the European Union understands it. And if they don’t, we’re going to have to explain it to them.” After Vance’s speech, Frederiksen said Denmark was increasing its defense capabilities in the region, including new Arctic ships and long-range drones. With Greenland part of NATO, she also emphasized the collective responsibility of the alliance to defend the Arctic in response to the Russian threat. After Denmark stood “side by side with Americans” in its war against terror, she said it was “not a fair way” for Vance to refer to Denmark. Denmark’s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper Møller Sørensen, thanked Vance “for taking a closer look at Arctic security” and said both countries agree more could be done. “Greenland & Denmark share a desire to strengthen our already incredibly close ties with our friend & ally,” he wrote on social media. Ahead of Vance’s arrival, four of the five parties elected to Greenland’s parliament earlier this month signed an agreement to form a new, broad-based coalition government. The parties banded together in the face of Trump’s designs on the territory. “It is a time when we as a population are under pressure,” the prime minister-designate, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said before the accord was signed to applause and cheers in the capital, Nuuk. He added that “we must stick together. Together we are strongest,” Greenland broadcaster KNR reported. In a post on Instagram, Frederiksen congratulated Nielsen and his incoming government, and said, “I look forward to close cooperation in an unnecessarily conflict-filled time.” Frederiksen said Tuesday that the U.S. visit, which was originally set for three days, created “unacceptable pressure.” She has said Denmark wants to work with the U.S. on defense and security, but Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders. Initially, Vance’s wife, Usha Vance, had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. The vice president subsequently said he would join her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again — after protests from Greenland and Denmark — to a one-day visit to the military post only. Inhabitants of Nuuk, which is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Pituffik, voiced concern about Vance’s visit and the U.S. interest in their island. Cora Høy, 22, said Vance was “welcome if he wants to see it but of course Greenland is not for sale.” She added that “it’s not normal around here” with all the attention Greenland is getting. “I feel now every day is about (Trump) and I just want to get away from it.” “It’s all a bit crazy. Of course the population here is a bit shook up,” said 30-year-old Inuk Kristensen. “My opinion is the same as everyone’s: Of course you don’t do things this way. You don’t just come here and say that you want to buy the place.” As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources. “We need to ensure that America is leading in the Arctic, because we know that if America doesn’t, other nations will fill the gap where we fall behind,” Vance said. ___ Grieshaber reported from Berlin and Madhani from Washington.

Respond with a single word: left, center, or right.", "input": "Tax season has officially started: Here's everything you need to know before filing IRS will start accepting tax returns on Jan 29 – here are all of your questions answered Tax season officially kicks off on Monday, when the IRS will start officially accepting and processing 2023 tax returns. Don't fret: Here is everything that taxpayers need to know about this year's filing season. When is the deadline to file taxes? Most taxpayers will have until Monday, April 15 to submit their returns or request an extension. There are some exceptions. Taxpayers living in Maine or Massachusetts have until April 17 to file their taxes due to state holidays. Individuals who live in a federally declared disaster area may also have additional time to file. How do I apply for an individual tax extension? An individual can request an extension online by filling out Form 4868 using the IRS’ \"Free File\" tool. You need to submit the form by the tax-filing deadline or print the form and mail it to the IRS address for your state, making sure it's postmarked by April 15. Once you file the extension, you have until Oct. 15, 2024, to file your taxes. NEW IRS TAX BRACKETS TAKE EFFECT IN 2024, MEANING YOUR PAYCHECK COULD BE BIGGER NEXT YEAR However, there are pros and cons to requesting an extension. It can give filers more time to thoroughly review their return and take advantage of all the tax benefits, like various deductions and credits, that are available to them to help them reduce liability. By pushing back the filing date, you can also avoid a failure-to-file penalty – an extra 5% per month on the unpaid amount, which can add up to 25% of the tax due. If you file for an extension, you have until Oct. 15 before the penalty starts accruing. Experts caution that filing for an extension does not mean you can delay paying the government the taxes that are owed. \"Extensions are a good tool to give you an extra six months,\" Eric Bronnenkant, head of tax at online financial adviser Betterment, told FOX Business. \"However, know they are not a free lunch to defer payments.\" SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS COULD BE HIT WITH A SURPRISE TAX BILL THIS YEAR How can I get my tax refund ASAP? The majority of taxpayers can typically expect to receive a refund from Uncle Sam. For many families, the money can be substantial. Nearly three-quarters of filers received a tax refund in 2023, with an average payment worth about $3,176. In order to receive your refund within 21 days of filing, the IRS has cautioned that you must file your return electronically, ensure that it is accurate and complete and request to receive the refund via direct deposit. The IRS expects to receive more than 128.7 million individual tax returns by this year's deadline. However, the tax-collecting agency warned that some returns may require \"additional review\" and take longer to process if their systems identify any errors, if there are mistakes on the return or if it suspects theft or fraud. \"Once you're relatively certain that you have all of your tax documents, file as soon as you can so that you can start investing your money,\" Bronnenkant said. \"Because, in general, the IRS doesn't pay you interest on your refunds. So getting that money in your hands sooner is better for sure.\" REMOTE WORKERS FACE A DOUBLE TAXATION THREAT Can I track my refund status? Taxpayers can track their refund using the IRS' \"Check My Refund Status\" tool. When you submit your information, you can see when the IRS received your return, when your refund has been approved and when your refund has been delivered. The information is all available 24 hours after you've filed your taxes electronically, or four weeks after submitting a paper return. To use the tool, you need to provide your Social Security number, filing status and exact refund amount. What if I am expecting to receive the child tax credit or earned income tax credit? The IRS is warning of a pain point for early taxpayers hoping to collect the earned income tax credit, a tax break for low- to moderate-income workers, or the child tax credit. If you claim either tax credit, the IRS cannot issue your refund before mid-February. What do PayPal, Venmo and Cash App users need to know this year? The IRS announced in November that it delayed a controversial tax reporting requirement targeting Americans who made more than $600 online through third-party payment apps like Venmo or PayPal. The rule change – approved by Democrats in March 2021 with the passage of the American Rescue Plan – would have required payment platforms, including Venmo, PayPal, Etsy and Airbnb, to send Form 1099-K to the IRS and users if their transactions totaled more than $600 over the course of the year. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Instead, the IRS will treat 2023 as \"an additional transition year,\" meaning that payment apps will not be required to send users Form 1099-K unless their gross income exceeded $20,000 or they had 200 separate transactions within a calendar year. Beginning in 2024, that basic reporting threshold will be increased to $5,000. Business owners are already required to report that income to the IRS. The new rule simply means the IRS will figure out what business owners earned on the cash apps, regardless of what that individual actually reports on their 1099-K, because it broadens the scope of the threshold."}

Many of these rumors centered around a piece of software from Dominion Voting Systems. We've addressed a few of these rumors in a previous article, but the most prevalent claim, and one that was spread by U.S. President Donald Trump himself on Nov. 12, 2020, was that Dominion software had deleted 2.7 million votes that had been cast for the incumbent: There is no truth to this claim. On Nov. 12, 2020, a coalition of federal and state officials, including members of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED), released a statement calling the 2020 election the \"most secure in American history.\" The statement went on to specifically address Trump's false claim about votes being deleted, writing that \"there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" Here is the statement in full: The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. Right now, across the country, election officials are reviewing and double checking the entire election process prior to finalizing the result. When states have close elections, many will recount ballots. All of the states with close results in the 2020 presidential race have paper records of each vote, allowing the ability to go back and count each ballot if necessary. This is an added benefit for security and resilience. This process allows for the identification and correction of any mistakes or errors. There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised. Other security measures like pre-election testing, state certification of voting equipment, and the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's (EAC) certification of voting equipment help to build additional confidence in the voting systems used in 2020. While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too. When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they administer elections. Trump did not provide any evidence to support his false claim that 2.7 million votes were deleted by Dominion Software, but he did tag Channel Rion and One American News Network (OAN), a far-right web publisher that recently reported on these unsubstantiated claims. The OAN segment (which was archived by Mediate) claimed that an \"unaudited analysis of data obtained from Edison Research\" found that Dominion Voting Systems \"switched as many as 435,000 votes from President Trump to Joe Biden\" and that \"another 2.7 million Trump votes appear to have been deleted by Dominion.\" Edison Research President Larry Rosin, however, disputed these claims. In a statement to the The Dispatch Fact Check, Rosin said: \"Edison Research created no such report and we are not aware of any voter fraud.\" A spokesperson for Dominion Voting Systems issued a similar statement to the Denver Post: \"Dominion Voting Systems categorically denies any claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems. Our systems continue to reliably and accurately count ballots, and state and local election authorities have publicly confirmed the integrity of the process.\""}
